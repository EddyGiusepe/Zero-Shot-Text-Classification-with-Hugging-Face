            "The memo’s author was Frank Press, Carter’s chief science adviser and director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press was a tall, serious, geophysicist who had grown up poor in a Jewish family in Brooklyn, and was described as “brilliant” by his colleagues. Before working with the Carter administration, he had been director of the Seismological Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, and had consulted for federal agencies including the Navy and NASA.\n",

As a result, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 is now 12 percent above the pre-industrial revolution level and may grow to 1.5 to 2.0 times that level within 60 years. Because of the “greenhouse effect” of atmospheric CO2 the increased concentration will induce a global climatic warming of anywhere from 0.5 to 5°C.\n",

            "These far-sighted assertions were in line with the climate science that originated the previous decade, when the US government funded major science agencies focused on space, atmospheric and ocean science. Research produced for President Lyndon B Johnson in 1965 found that billions of tons of “carbon dioxide is being added to the earth’s atmosphere by the burning of coal, oil, and natural gas”.\n",

A rapid climatic change may result in large scale crop failures at a time when an increased world population taxes agriculture to the limits of productivity.\n",
            "\n",
            "Press was right. We have indeed seen the catastrophic effects of a climatic fluctuation, in the form of increasingly severe weather events including droughts, heatwaves, and hurricanes of greater intensity. Meanwhile, in many parts of the world heating has already stemmed increases in agricultural productivity, and large-scale food production crises are thought to be possible.\n",
            "\n",
            "The urgency of the problem derives from our inability to shift rapidly to non-fossil fuel sources once the climatic effects become evident not long after the year 2000; the situation could grow out of control before alternate energy sources and other remedial actions become effective.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is correct. By the 2000s, the effects of the climate crisis had become apparent in some regions in the form of more deadly heat waves and stronger floods and droughts.\n",
            "\n",
            "Press is correct that CO2 can take “hundreds of thousands of years to be fully removed from the atmosphere by natural processes following its emission”, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Scientists say that even if CO2 emissions were to be reduced to net zero, global temperatures would begin to stabilize, though not fall substantially.\n",
            "\n",

            "Ads, jokes and protests are one thing, though — hoax covers are something else entirely. And that’s the problem with a faked TIME cover about global warming that’s been floating around the Internet for some time. (Hat tip to the science blogger David Kirtley, who posted on this a couple of days ago.) You can see it here.\n",
            "\n",
            "The cover on the right is real. (I should know — I wrote the story about China and India that’s mentioned in the subhead.) The one on the left is very much not. It’s a doctored version of this cover, from 2007:\n",
            "\n",
            "Apparently the hoax cover has been floating around the Internet for at least a few years. I’m not sure who created it, and it doesn’t seem to have gotten a whole lot of traction, even among climate-science deniers. Though kudos to whoever initially put the fake cover together. That’s some pretty good photoshopping.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the hoax does touch on an important part of climate science — and one that’s often misunderstood by skeptics. Call it the Ice Age Fallacy. Skeptics argue that back in the 1970s both popular media and some scientists were far more worried about global cooling than they were about global warming. For some reason a Newsweek article on the next ice age, published back in 1975, gets a lot of the attention, though TIME did a version of the story, as did a number of other media outlets. The rationale goes this way: the fact that scientists were once supposedly so concerned about global cooling, which didn’t come true, just shows that we shouldn’t worry about the new fears of climate change.\n",
            "\n",
            "But as John Cook points out over at Skeptical Science, global cooling was much more an invention of the media than it was a real scientific concern. A survey of peer-reviewed scientific papers published between 1965 and 1979 shows that the large majority of research at the time predicted that the earth would warm as carbon-dioxide levels rose — as indeed it has. And some of those global-cooling projections were based on the idea that aerosol levels in the atmosphere — which are a product of air pollution from sources like coal burning and which contribute to cooling by deflecting sunlight in the atmosphere — would keep rising. But thanks to environmental legislation like the Clean Air Acts, global air-pollution levels — not including greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide — peaked in the 1970s and began declining.\n",
            "\n",
            "The reality is that scientists in the 1970s were just beginning to understand how climate change and aerosol pollution might impact global temperatures. Add in the media-hype cycle — which was true then as it is now — and you have some coverage that turned out to be wrong. But thanks to the Internet, those stories stay undead, recycled by notorious climate skeptics like George Will. Pay no attention to the Photoshop. It’s the science we should heed — and the science says man-made climate change is real and very, very worrying.\n",

            "Even if civilization on Earth stops polluting the biosphere with greenhouse gases, humanity could eventually be awash in too much heat, namely, the dissipated heat by-product generated by any nonrenewable energy source. Apart from the Sun's natural aging-which causes an approximately 1% luminosity rise for each 108 years and thus about 1Â°C increase in Earth's surface temperature-well within 1000 years our technological society could find itself up against a fundamental limit to growth: an unavoidable global heating of roughly 3Â°C dictated solely by the second law of thermodynamics, a biogeophysical effect often ignored when estimating future planetary warming scenarios.\n",
            "\n",
            "Nearly all energy used for human purposes is dissipated as heat within Earth's land-atmosphere system. Thermal energy released from non-renewable sources is therefore a climate forcing term. Averaged globally, this forcing is only +0.028 W m-2, but over the continental United States and western Europe, it is +0.39 and +0.68 W m-2, respectively. Here, present and future global inventories of anthropogenic heat flux (AHF) are developed, and parameterizations derived for seasonal and diurnal flux cycles. Equilibrium climate experiments show statistically-significant continental-scale surface warming (0.4-0.9Â°C) produced by one 2100 AHF scenario, but not by current or 2040 estimates. However, significant increases in annual-mean temperature and planetary boundary layer (PBL) height occur over gridcells where present-day AHF exceeds 3.0 W m-2. PBL expansion leads to a slight, but significant increase in atmospheric residence time of aerosols emitted from large-AHF regions. Hence, AHF may influence regional climate projections and contemporary chemistry-climate studies.\n",

            "An attempt is made to estimate the temperature changes resulting from doubling the present CO2 concentration by the use of a simplified three-dimensional general circulation model. This model contains the following simplications: a limited computational domain, an idealized topography, no beat transport by ocean currents, and fixed cloudiness. Despite these limitations, the results from this computation yield some indication of how the increase of CO2 concentration may affect the distribution of temperature in the atmosphere. It is shown that the CO2 increase raises the temperature of the model troposphere, whereas it lowers that of the model stratosphere. The tropospheric warming is somewhat larger than that expected from a radiative-convective equilibrium model. In particular, the increase of surface temperature in higher latitudes is magnified due to the recession of the snow boundary and the thermal stability of the lower troposphere which limits convective beating to the lowest layer. It is also shown that the doubling of carbon dioxide significantly increases the intensity of the hydrologic cycle of the model.\n",

            "This year’s wildfires and hurricanes leave no doubt that climate change remains a key issue for a growing number of Americans despite the nation’s deeply polarized politics, as numerous polls have shown. But this is hardly the first time the environment has been a political issue. In fact, the future of the planet was at stake in the presidential contest over 40 years ago—but no one knew it at the time.\n",
            "\n",
            "In 1980, President Jimmy Carter was running for reelection against former California Governor Ronald Reagan. The environment was a campaign issue, in part because Reagan had been quoted saying that more than 80 percent of nitrogen oxide air pollution is “caused by trees and vegetation.” (Reagan, the Sierra Club responded, was “just plain wrong.”) Carter, meanwhile, had signed 14 major pieces of environmental legislation, including the first funding of alternative energy, the first federal toxic waste cleanup (the Super Fund), the first fuel economy standards and important new laws to fight air, water and other forms of pollution. He also protected California’s redwood forest and 100 million acres in the Alaska Lands bill, which doubled the size of the National Park Service.\n",

            "\n",
            "When he became President, Carter was the first global leader to recognize the problem of climate change. In 1977, scratching his itch as a planner and steward of the earth, he commissioned the Global 2000 Report to the President, an ambitious effort to explore environmental challenges and the prospects of “sustainable development” (a new phrase) over the next 20 years. As part of that process, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) issued three reports contending with global warming, the last of which—issued the week before Carter left office—was devoted entirely to the long-term threat of what a handful of scientists then called “carbon dioxide pollution.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The report, written by Gus Speth, Carter’s top aide on the environment, urged “immediate action” and included calculations on CO2 emissions in the next decades that proved surprisingly accurate. The large-scale burning of oil, coal and other fossil fuels could lead to “widespread and pervasive changes in global climatic, economic, social, and agricultural patterns,” the CEQ report concluded with great prescience.\n",

            "One recommendation—covered in the very last paragraph of a New York Times story that ran on page A13—encouraged industrialized nations to reach agreement on the safe maximum level of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere.

            "\n",
            "With these facts in hand, Reagan’s landslide victory over Carter in the 1980 election takes on a tragic dimension: Carter had acted on every other CEQ report issued in the previous four years with aggressive legislation and executive orders. He almost certainly would have done so on this one, too, had he been reelected. Gains made under Carter’s presidential leadership in the early 1980s might have bought the planet precious time. Instead, for the next 12 years, under Reagan and George H.W. Bush, the U.S. government would view global warming as largely unworthy of study, much less action. Then came 25 years of stop-and-start efforts under administrations of both parties, followed by a return to denial under Trump and, then, re-entry into the Paris process under President Joe Biden.\n",

This temperature increase is consistent with the calculated effect due to measured increases of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Variations of volcanic aerosols and possibly solar luminosity appear to be primary causes of observed fluctuations about the mean trend of increasing temperature. It is shown that the anthropogenic carbon dioxide warming should emerge from the noise level of natural climate variability by the end of the century, and there is a high probability of warming in the 1980s.

            "While all eyes were turned on carbon dioxide, almost by chance a           few researchers discovered that other gases emitted by human activity           could have serious global impacts. In the 1970s attention centered on damage to the atmosphere's protective ozone layer, and nations combined to diminish the risk. In the mid 1980s scientists realized that other gases, especially methane and nitrates, added together could be as important as carbon dioxide in bringing global warming. The sources and interactions of the gases were multiple and complex, and research brought many surprises; for example, the world's livestock turned out to be a major problem. As methane levels soared ever higher, researchers warned that feedbacks such as increased emissions from warming soils could dangerously accelerate global warming. The warnings had little impact on policy.

The isotope profile covers the last 150 kyr, back to the ice age which preceded the last interglacial, and has essentially been undisturbed by flow conditions. The results indicate that the present Holocene was preceded by a long glacial period marked by two relatively warm interstadials. The well marked last interglacial was significantly warmer than the Holocene and the end of the previous glacial was quite similar to the last glacial maximum.

            "The consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared by 90%–100% of publishing climate scientists according to six independent studies by co-authors of this paper. Those results are consistent with the 97% consensus reported by Cook et al (Environ. Res. Lett. 8 024024) based on 11 944 abstracts of research papers, of which 4014 took a position on the cause of recent global warming. A survey of authors of those papers (N = 2412 papers) also supported a 97% consensus. Tol (2016 Environ. Res. Lett. 11 048001) comes to a different conclusion using results from surveys of non-experts such as economic geologists and a self-selected group of those who reject the consensus. We demonstrate that this outcome is not unexpected because the level of consensus correlates with expertise in climate science. At one point, Tol also reduces the apparent consensus by assuming that abstracts that do not explicitly state the cause of global warming ('no position') represent non-endorsement, an approach that if applied elsewhere would reject consensus on well-established theories such as plate tectonics. We examine the available studies and conclude that the finding of 97% consensus in published climate research is robust and consistent with other surveys of climate scientists and peer-reviewed studies.\n",

            "Climate scientists overwhelmingly agree that humans are causing recent global warming. The consensus position is articulated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) statement that 'human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century' (Qin et al 2014, p 17). The National Academies of Science from 80 countries have issued statements endorsing the consensus position (table S2). Nevertheless, the existence of the consensus continues to be questioned. Here we summarize studies that quantify expert views and examine common flaws in criticisms of consensus estimates. In particular, we are responding to a comment by Tol (2016) on Cook et al (2013, referred to as C13). We show that contrary to Tol's claim that the results of C13 differ from earlier studies, the consensus of experts is robust across all the studies conducted by coauthors of this correspondence.\n",
            "\n",
            "Tol's erroneous conclusions stem from conflating the opinions of non-experts with experts and assuming that lack of affirmation equals dissent. A detailed technical response to Tol is provided in (S1) where we specifically address quibbles about abstract ID numbers, timing of ratings, inter-rater communication and agreement, and access to ratings. None of those points raised by Tol affect the calculated consensus. Most importantly, the 97% consensus derived from abstract ratings is validated by the authors of the papers studied who responded to our survey (N = 2142 papers) and also reported a 97% consensus in papers taking a position. The remainder of this paper shows that a high level of scientific consensus, in agreement with our results, is a robust finding in the scientific literature. This is used to illustrate and address the issues raised by Tol that are relevant to our main conclusion.\n",
            "\n",
            "Efforts to measure scientific consensus need to identify a relevant and representative population of experts, assess their professional opinion in an appropriate manner, and avoid distortions from ambiguous elements in the sample. Approaches that have been employed to assess expert views on anthropogenic global warming (AGW) include analysing peer-reviewed climate papers (Oreskes 2004; C13), surveying members of the relevant scientific community (Bray and von Storch 2007, Doran and Zimmerman 2009, Bray 2010, Rosenberg et al 2010, Farnsworth and Lichter 2012, Verheggen et al 2014, Stenhouse et al 2014, Carlton et al 2015), compiling public statements by scientists (Anderegg et al 2010), and mathematical analyses of citation patterns (Shwed and Bearman 2010). We define domain experts as scientists who have published peer-reviewed research in that domain, in this case, climate science. Consensus estimates for these experts are listed in table 1, with the range of estimates resulting primarily from differences in selection of the expert pool, the definition of what entails the consensus position, and differences in treatment of no position responses/papers.\n",
            "\n",
            "The studies in table 1 have taken various approaches to selecting and querying pools of experts. Oreskes (2004) identified expressions of views on AGW in the form of peer-reviewed papers on 'global climate change'. This analysis found no papers rejecting AGW in a sample of 928 papers published from 1993 to 2003, that is, 100% consensus among papers stating a position on AGW.\n",
            "\n",
            "Following a similar methodology, C13 analysed the abstracts of 11 944 peer-reviewed papers published between 1991 and 2011 that matched the search terms 'global climate change' or 'global warming' in the ISI Web of Science search engine. Among the 4014 abstracts stating a position on human-caused global warming, 97.1% were judged as having implicitly or explicitly endorsed the consensus. In addition, the study authors were invited to rate their own papers, based on the contents of the full paper, not just the abstract. Amongst 1381 papers self-rated by their authors as stating a position on human-caused global warming, 97.2% endorsed the consensus.\n",
            "\n",
            "Shwed and Bearman (2010) employed citation analysis of 9432 papers on global warming and climate published from 1975 to 2008. Unlike surveys or classifications of abstracts, this method was entirely mathematical and blind to the content of the literature being examined. By determining the modularity of citation networks, they concluded, 'Our results reject the claim of inconclusive science on climate change and identify the emergence of consensus earlier than previously thought' (p. 831). Although this method does not produce a numerical consensus value, it independently demonstrates the same level of scientific consensus on AGW as exists for the fact that smoking causes cancer.\n",
            "\n",
            "Anderegg et al (2010) identified climate experts as those who had authored at least 20 climate-related publications and chose their sample from those who had signed public statements regarding climate change. By combining published scientific papers and public statements, Anderegg et al determined that 97%–98% of the 200 most-published climate scientists endorsed the IPCC conclusions on AGW.\n",
            "\n",
            "Other studies have directly queried scientists, typically choosing a sample of scientists and identifying subsamples of those who self-identify as climate scientists or actively publish in the field. Doran and Zimmerman (2009) surveyed 3146 Earth scientists, asking whether 'human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures,' and subsampled those who were actively publishing climate scientists. Overall, they found that 82% of Earth scientists indicated agreement, while among the subset with greatest expertise in climate science, the agreement was 97.4%.\n",
            "\n",
            "Bray and von Storch (2007) and Bray (2010) repeatedly surveyed different populations of climate scientists in 1996, 2003 and 2008. The questions did not specify a time period for climate change (indeed, in 2008, 36% of the participants defined the term 'climate change' to refer to 'changes in climate at any time for whatever reason'). Therefore, the reported consensus estimates of 40% (1996) and 53% (2003) (which included participants not stating a view on AGW) suffered from both poor control of expert selection and ambiguous questions. Their 2008 study, finding 83% agreement, had a more robust sample selection and a more specific definition of the consensus position on attribution.\n",
            "\n",
            "Verheggen et al (2014) surveyed 1868 scientists, drawn in part from a public repository of climate scientists (the same source as was used by Anderegg et al), and from scientists listed in C13, supplemented by authors of recent climate-related articles and with particular effort expended to include signatories of public statements critical of mainstream climate science. 85% of all respondents (which included a likely overrepresentation of contrarian non-scientists) who stated a position agreed that anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs) are the dominant driver of recent global warming. Among respondents who reported having authored more than 10 peer-reviewed climate-related publications, approximately 90% agreed that greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause of global warming.\n",
            "\n",
            "Stenhouse et al (2014) collected responses from 1854 members of the American Meteorological Society (AMS). Among members whose area of expertise was climate science, with a publication focus on climate, 78% agreed that the cause of global warming over the past 150 years was mostly human, with an additional 10% (for a total of 88%) indicating the warming was caused equally by human activities and natural causes. An additional 6% answered 'I do not believe we know enough to determine the degree of human causation.' To make a more precise comparison with the Doran and Zimmerman findings, these respondents were emailed one additional survey question to ascertain if they thought human activity had contributed to the global warming that has occurred over the past 150 years; among the 6% who received this question, 5% indicated there had been some human contribution to the warming. Thus, Stenhouse et al (2014) concluded that '93% of actively publishing climate scientists indicated they are convinced that humans have contributed to global warming.'\n",
            "\n",
            "Carlton et al (2015) adapted questions from Doran and Zimmerman (2009) to survey 698 biophysical scientists across various disciplines, finding that 91.9% of them agreed that (1) mean global temperatures have generally risen compared with pre-1800s levels and that (2) human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures. Among the 306 who indicated that 'the majority of my research concerns climate change or the impacts of climate change', there was 96.7% consensus on the existence of AGW.\n",

            "The Pew Research Center (2015) conducted a detailed survey of 3748 members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) to assess views on several key science topics.

            "\n",
            "Despite the diversity of sampling techniques and approaches, a consistent picture of an overwhelming consensus among experts on anthropogenic climate change has emerged from these studies. Another recurring finding is that higher scientific agreement is associated with higher levels of expertise in climate science (Oreskes 2004, Doran and Zimmerman 2009, Anderegg 2010, Verheggen et al 2014).\n",
            "\n",
            "How can vastly different interpretations of consensus arise? A significant contributor to variation in consensus estimates is the conflation of general scientific opinion with expert scientific opinion. Figure 1 demonstrates that consensus estimates are highly sensitive to the expertise of the sampled group. An accurate estimate of scientific consensus reflects the level of agreement among experts in climate science; that is, scientists publishing peer-reviewed research on climate change. As shown in table 1, low estimates of consensus arise from samples that include non-experts such as scientists (or non-scientists) who are not actively publishing climate research, while samples of experts are consistent in showing overwhelming consensus.\n",

            "Figure 1. Level of consensus on AGW versus expertise across different studies. Right colour bar indicates posterior density of Bayesian 99% credible intervals.

            "\n",
            "Tol (2016) reports consensus estimates ranging from 7% to 100% from the same studies described above. His broad range is due to sub-groupings of scientists with different levels of expertise. For example, the sub-sample with 7% agreement was selected from those expressing an 'unconvinced' position on AGW (Verheggen et al 2014). This selection criterion does not provide a valid estimate of consensus for two reasons: first, this subsample was selected based on opinion on climate change, predetermining the level of estimated consensus. Second, this does not constitute a sample of experts, as non-experts were included. Anderegg (2010) found that nearly one-third of the unconvinced group lacked a PhD, and only a tiny fraction had a PhD in a climate-relevant discipline. Eliminating less published scientists from both these samples resulted in consensus values of 90% and 97%–98% for Verheggen et al (2014) and Anderegg et al (2010), respectively. Tol's (2016) conflation of unrepresentative non-expert sub-samples and samples of climate experts is a misrepresentation of the results of previous studies, including those published by a number of coauthors of this paper.\n",
            "\n",
            "In addition to varying with expertise, consensus estimates may differ based on their approach to studies or survey responses that do not state an explicit position on AGW. Taking a conservative approach, C13 omitted abstracts that did not state a position on AGW to derive its consensus estimate of 97%; a value shown to be robust when compared with the estimate derived from author responses. In contrast, in one analysis, Tol (2016) effectively treats no-position abstracts as rejecting AGW, thereby deriving consensus values less than 35%. Equating no-position papers with rejection or an uncertain position on AGW is inconsistent with the expectation of decreasing reference to a consensual position as that consensus strengthens (Oreskes 2007, Shwed and Bearman 2010). Powell (2015) shows that applying Tol's method to the established paradigm of plate tectonics would lead Tol to reject the scientific consensus in that field because nearly all current papers would be classified as taking 'no position'.\n",
            "\n",
            "We have shown that the scientific consensus on AGW is robust, with a range of 90%–100% depending on the exact question, timing and sampling methodology. This is supported by multiple independent studies despite variations in the study timing, definition of consensus, or differences in methodology including surveys of scientists, analyses of literature or of citation networks. Tol (2016) obtains lower consensus estimates through a flawed methodology, for example by conflating non-expert and expert views, and/or making unsupported assumptions about sources that do not specifically state a position about the consensus view.\n",
            "\n",
            "An accurate understanding of scientific consensus, and the ability to recognize attempts to undermine it, are important for public climate literacy. Public perception of the scientific consensus has been found to be a gateway belief, affecting other climate beliefs and attitudes including policy support (Ding et al 2011, McCright et al 2013, van der Linden et al 2015). However, many in the public, particularly in the US, still believe scientists disagree to a large extent about AGW (Leiserowitz et al 2015), and many political leaders, again particularly in the US, insist that this is so. Leiserowitz et al (2015) found that only 12% of the US public accurately estimate the consensus at 91%–100%. Further, Plutzer et al 2016 found that only 30% of middle-school and 45% of high-school science teachers were aware that the scientific consensus is above 80%, with 31% of teachers who teach climate change presenting contradictory messages that emphasize both the consensus and the minority position.\n",
            "\n",
            "Misinformation about climate change has been observed to reduce climate literacy levels (McCright et al 2016, Ranney and Clark 2016), and manufacturing doubt about the scientific consensus on climate change is one of the most effective means of reducing acceptance of climate change and support for mitigation policies (Oreskes 2010, van der Linden et al 2016). Therefore, it should come as no surprise that the most common argument used in contrarian op-eds about climate change from 2007 to 2010 was that there is no scientific consensus on human-caused global warming (Elsasser and Dunlap 2012, Oreskes and Conway 2011). The generation of climate misinformation persists, with arguments against climate science increasing relative to policy arguments in publications by conservative organisations (Boussalis and Coan 2016).\n",
            "\n",
            "Consequently, it is important that scientists communicate the overwhelming expert consensus on AGW to the public (Maibach et al 2014, Cook and Jacobs 2014). Explaining the 97% consensus has been observed to increase acceptance of climate change (Lewandowsky et al 2013, Cook and Lewandowsky 2016) with the greatest change among conservatives (Kotcher et al 2014).\n",
            "\n",
            "From a broader perspective, it doesn't matter if the consensus number is 90% or 100%. The level of scientific agreement on AGW is overwhelmingly high because the supporting evidence is overwhelmingly strong.\n",

            "The consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared by 90%-100% of publishing climate scientists according to six independent studies by co-authors of this paper. Those results are consistent with the 97% consensus reported by Cook et al (Environ. Res. Lett.  8 024024) based on 11 944 abstracts of research papers, of which 4014 took a position on the cause of recent global warming. A survey of authors of those papers (N = 2412 papers) also supported a 97% consensus. Tol (2016 Environ. Res. Lett.  11 048001) comes to a different conclusion using results from surveys of non-experts such as economic geologists and a self-selected group of those who reject the consensus. We demonstrate that this outcome is not unexpected because the level of consensus correlates with expertise in climate science. At one point, Tol also reduces the apparent consensus by assuming that abstracts that do not explicitly state the cause of global warming (â€˜no positionâ€™) represent non-endorsement, an approach that if applied elsewhere would reject consensus on well-established theories such as plate tectonics. We examine the available studies and conclude that the finding of 97% consensus in published climate research is robust and consistent with other surveys of climate scientists and peer-reviewed studies.\n",

From a dataset of 88125 climate-related papers published since 2012, when this question was last addressed comprehensively, we examine a randomized subset of 3000 such publications. We also use a second sample-weighted approach that was specifically biased with keywords to help identify any sceptical peer-reviewed papers in the whole dataset.

            "The scientific consensus on human-caused global warming has been a topic of intense interest in recent decades. This is in part due to the important role of public perception of expert consensus, which has downstream impacts on public opinion and support for mitigation policies. Numerous studies, using diverse methodologies and measures of climate expertise, have quantified the scientific consensus, finding between 90% and 100% agreement on human-caused global warming with multiple studies converging on 97% agreement. This study revisits the consensus among geoscientists ten years after an initial survey of experts, while exploring different ways to define expertise and the level of agreement among these groups. We sent 10 929 invitations to participate in our survey to a verified email list of geosciences faculty at reporting academic and research institutions and received 2780 responses. In addition to analyzing the raw survey results, we independently quantify how many publications self-identified climate experts published in the field of climate change research and compare that to their survey response on questions about climate change. As well as a binary approach classifying someone as 'expert' or 'non-expert', we also look at expertise as a scale. We find that agreement on anthropogenic global warming is high (91% to 100%) and generally increases with expertise. Out of a group of 153 independently confirmed climate experts, 98.7% of those scientists indicated that the Earth is getting warmer mostly because of human activity such as burning fossil fuels. Among those with the highest level of expertise (independently confirmed climate experts who each published 20+ peer reviewed papers on climate change between 2015 and 2019) there was 100% agreement that the Earth is warming mostly because of human activity.\n",

            "(Continued) By the end of the 1970s, scientific opinion had settled on warming             as most likely, probably becoming evident around the year 2000 —             which at that point lay in a remote and uncertain future. Some scientists nevertheless             went directly to the public to demand action to avert the warming, and             a few politicians took up the issue. During the hot summer of 1988, a             few outspoken scientists, convinced by new evidence that rapid climate             change might be imminent, made the public fully aware of the problem.             Scientific discussions now became entangled with fierce political debates             over the costs of regulating greenhouse gases. Corporations and conservatives spent large sums to sow uncertainty and denial of any danger from global warming.             It was not until around 2005 that American media reported clearly that             scientists had resolved the controversy, while films and ominous weather             events gave citizens a better idea of what global warming might mean.             The majority of Americans had moved gradually             to a vague feeling that some kind of action should be taken. But the issue became increasingly politicized; on the right, doubt and  denial increased. Stronger worries meanwhile grew  among people in most other countries.

            "The fires  of public interest were stoked                   by Congressional hearings, promoted especially by Albert Gore, who                   had taken an early interest in the topic. Still more newsworthy                   was a controversy that broke out in 1983 when the Environmental                   Protection Agency (EPA) issued a report declaring that the future                   temperature rise could be catastrophic. As the New York Times                   noted in a front-page story, the EPA report was the first time a                   Federal agency had declared that global warming was \"not a                   theoretical problem but a threat whose effects will be felt within                   a few years.\" Within decades, the Times suggested,                    food production could suffer. That stood in stark contradiction to a soothing report that the National Academy                   of Sciences  issued just days later. According to this report,                   as Sullivan summarized it in a Times editorial, \"the greenhouse               effect is for real but we can live with it.\"\n",

            "After the spate of global warming stories in the summer of 1988,                             media attention inevitably declined as more normal weather set in.                             As noted above, even for a potential danger, readers                             will become discouraged or simply bored when nothing immediate is                             done, and editors will look for something novel to fill their \"news hole.\" Besides, the winter of 1989 was a particularly                                 cold one, and people tend to take their cue fromt he most recent few months of weather. The climate change story also lacked an interesting enemy,                                 a villain (other than ourselves) dito blame for the world's woes.(112) But even if an issue is no longer                                 in the forefront of everyone's mind, it can remain present. Although                                 press coverage of global warming sank after its peak in the summer                                 of 1988, it now fluctuated around a much higher average level than                               in the early 1980s.(113)\n",

            "Even more newsworthy                   was the international Kyoto Climate Conference, scheduled for December                   1997. Here was where national governments would make real economic and political                   decisions on the use of fossil fuels. The administration of President                   Bill Clinton made a bid for public support for a treaty, holding                   a well-publicized conference of experts on climate change in October.                   Editors saw a story line of conflict developing as they anticipated                   the Conference. News reports were further stimulated by advertising                   campaigns and other intense public relations efforts, funded by                   environmental organizations on the one hand, by the Global Climate                   Coalition of industrial corporations on the other. Television stories                   dealing with global warming jumped from a mere dozen in July-September                   to well over 200 in October-December. Surveys conducted around the                   time of the meeting found about ten percent of the American public                   saying they followed the global warming news \"very closely,\"                   a substantial fraction for such an issue (for more exciting stories, like a celebrity scandal,                   the fraction could be several times higher). Most of the news items                   asserted that global warming was underway, with barely a tenth including                   any expression of doubt.\n",

            "Reports of                   official studies by scientific panels each had                   their day in the limelight, but rarely more than a day. Stories                   made more of an impression if they dealt with something visible,                   as when ice floes the size of a small nation split off from                    Antarctic ice shelves.(134) Other chances to mention global climate change came in                   stories about heat waves, floods, and coastal storms, especially                   when the events were more damaging than anything in recent memory.                   Citizens who attended more closely would see stories about shifts                   in the range of species, from birds and butterflies to insects pests                   and diseases. The concerns were largely parochial. Media in the                   United States would scarcely notice a record-breaking heat wave                   or flood that stirred up fears of global warming in Europe, and vice versa.(135)\n",

            "Many people in these focus groups were convinced that not only                   climate changes but all environmental harms were the fault of social                   decline  a rising tide of selfishness, gluttony and corruption.                   (In one week of unusual warmth during November 1989, I heard two                   people separately say that the Earth was paying us back for the                   harm we humans were doing to it.) People saw climate change through the filter of their world-views about how nature works, what makes for a fair society, and so forth, views that they had developed since childhood. Many thought first of a generalized \"pollution,\"                   the material and moral evils intertwined.  Belief in an all-powerful God had a major influence. Some believers,  including prominent                   scientists, wondered if we had invited divine retribution. Most                   Americans believed they were personally powerless to change  the prevailing morality and society, and therefore saw the problem of global warming as                   insoluble. Anxious and baffled, \"people literally don't like to                   think or talk about the subject,\" the authors of the 1998 study concluded.                   \"Their concern translates into frustration rather than support for action.\" Later studies found much the same.

            "As often happens               with such issues, after the wave of attention surged forward it receded:               The number of media reports on global warming fell almost as fast               during 2008 as it had risen during 2006.  This was a common feature of long-running stories such as those involving the environment. After a while other issues of the moment would arise and capture the attention of media and the public, an \"issue-attention cycle.\" Any shift in  economic and political problems would push environmental concerns out of the limelight.Polls of Americans in 2009               found that they had grown a bit less concerned about global               warming.  One probable reason was the “finite pool of worry.” With the worst economic recession in two generations underway, people were preoccupied with immediate problems.(152a)\n",

            "Good scientists take their time; they understand that at the frontier of what is known, no finding can be trusted until it has been confirmed by other findings, a laboriously slow process. The news media, however, naturally featured the latest results. Hurricanes were increasing!...oops, no they weren't! The oceans were warming! ...no, they were cooling! ...oops,             they really were warming! Small wonder if many citizens  in the early 2000s believed concluded that climate science was unreliable.\n",

            "Nobody escaped the drumbeat of scientific reports on diminishing ice and advancing temperatures, or the accounts of exceptional heat waves, floods and droughts around the world. The media captured audiences with gripping visuals of terrifying wildfires in North America and Australia and gigantic storms in every tropical sea. News reporters began to notice the scientists who were attributing damage from a particular weather catastrophe to global warming. Nearly all television weather reporters now accepted the scientists' consensus, and many had begun to talk to their audiences about climate change. In the five years 2017-2021 the fraction of Americans who said they were seriously \"alarmed\" by global warming rose from 18% to 33% of the adult population. For the first time the issue played a significant role in American electoral politics as  presidential candidates debated climate policies at length. To be sure, climate was only one of many issues people worried about (jobs, health care, crime...), and for a large majority of the public it was far from the top of the list.\n",

            "Uncertainty about science was part of a general mistrust of all elites and institutions that had been spreading steadily since the 1960s. The attitude was reflected in a 2021 movie, \"Don.'t Look Up,\" which the creators publicized as a response to the climate danger— the first widely seen and widely discussed such movie since 2004. What audiences actually got was a dark satire damning the idiocy of media, industry and government all together.(160*)\n",

Normally an urgent fact, for example an enemy who threatens to devastate a city, or a hurricane that actually does so, will mobilize citizens to unite in common effort. Scientists had expected at first that global warming would do just that. Tragically, the nature of modern public discourse, and the interests that drove it, led in a different direction.\n",

In 2000 Patrick Michaels claimed that time had shown Hansen's 1988 prediction             of temperature increase was exaggerated by 450%, a claim later picked             up by novelist Michael Crichton and others. In fact Hansen had presented             three scenarios, including a worst-case one  (accelerating emissions including CFCs, etc.) and two more-likely             ones. Michaels et al. spoke only of the worst-case scenario and did not             mention Hansen's middle scenario, which came closest to the actual rise of greenhouse gases. The prediction for this scenario tracked the global temperature rise to 2005,  ran well ahead. In the 2010s critics claimed the discrepancy showed all modeling was faulty, but after 2015 global temperatures rose close to Hansen's decades-old prediction.

Using trend and sentiment analysis is one method whereby researchers can identify changes in public perception that can be used to enhance the development of a social consciousness towards a specific public interest. The following study assessed Relative search volume (RSV) patterns for global warming (GW) and Climate change (CC) to determine public knowledge and awareness of these terms. In conjunction with this, the researchers looked at the sentiment connected to these terms in social media networks. It was found that there was a relationship between the awareness of the information and the amount of publicity generated around the terminology. Furthermore, the primary driver for the increase in awareness was an increase in publicity in either a positive or a negative light. Sentiment analysis further confirmed that the primary emotive connections to the words were derived from the original context in which the word was framed. Thus having awareness or knowledge of a topic is strongly related to its public exposure in the media, and the emotional context of this relationship is dependent on the context in which the relationship was originally established. This has value in fields like conservation, law enforcement, or other fields where the practice can and often does have two very strong emotive responses based on the context of the problems being examined.\n",

They are used interactively by the news agencies, without a thought towards their actual meaning [3, 4]. Therefore, the public in trying to identify changes in the news and their understanding of those changes looks for the meaning of those terms online.

            "The process of using social media to obtain information on public opinion is a practice that has been utilized with increasing frequency in modern research for subjects ranging from politics [6, 7] to linguistics [8–10] complex systems [11, 12] to environment [13]. This variety of research belies the flexibility of the approach, the large availability of data availability for mining in order to formulate a response to public opinion regarding the subject being assessed.

These two terms therefore can be used to determine how people understand the parallel concepts, especially if they are used as internet search query terms in trend analysis. However, searching the internet falls into two patterns, searches for work or for personal interest, neither of which can be determined from the trend engines. The By following the searches, it is possible to determine the range of public interest in the two terms, based on the respective volumes of the search queries. Previously in order to mine public opinion on a subject, government agencies had to revert to polling and surveys, which while being effective did not cover a very large component of the population [15–17].\n",
            "\n",
            "Google trend data is one method of measuring popularity of a subject within the population. Individuals searching for a topic use search keywords to obtain the desired information [5, 18]. These keywords are topic sensitive, and therefore indicate the level of knowledge regarding the searched topic. The two primary word phrases here “climate change” and “global warming” are unilateral terms that indicate a level of awareness about the issue which is indicative of the individuals interest in that subject [5, 19, 20]. Google trend data relates how often a term is searched, that is the frequency of a search term can be identified from the results of the Google® trend analysis. While frequency is not a direct measure of popularity, it does indicate if a search term is common or uncommon and the value of that term to the public at large. The relationship between frequency and popularity lies in the volume of searches by a large number of individuals over specific time duration. Therefore, by identifying the number of searches during a specific period, it is possible to come to a proximate understanding of how popular or common a term is for the general population [21]. However, the use of trend data is more appropriately used to identify awareness of an issue rather than its popularity.\n",
            "\n",
            "This brings us to sentiment analysis. Part of the connection between the search and the populations’ awareness of an issue can be measured using how they refer to the subject in question. This sentiment, is found in different forms of social media, or social networking sites sites i.e. twitter®, Facebook®, linked in® and personal blogs [7, 22–24]. Thus, the original information, which was found on the internet, becomes influenced by personal attitudes and opinions [25]and then redistributed throughout the internet, accessible to anyone who has an internet connection and the desire to search. This behavior affects the information that now provides the opportunity to assess public sentiment regarding the prevailing attitudes regarding environmental issues [26, 27]. To assess this we used Google® and Twitter® data to understand public concerns related to climate change and global warming. Google trend was used to trace changes in interest between the two phenomena. Tweets (comments made on Twitter®) were analyzed to identify negative or positive emotional responses.\n",
            "\n",
            "Comparatively, twitter data is more indicative of how people refer to topics of interest [28–31], in a manner that is very linguistically restricted. As well, twitter is used as a platform for verbal expression of emotional responses. Due to the restrictions on tweet size (each tweet can only be 140 characters in length), it is necessary to be more direct in dealing with topics of interest to the tweeter. Therefore, the tweets are linguistically more emotionally charged and can be used to define a level of emotional response by the tweeter.\n",
            "\n",
            "The choice of target words for the tweets and for the Google trend searches were the specific topic phrases [32, 33]. These were chosen because of the descriptive nature of the phrases. Scientific literature is very specific in its use and therefore has very definitive meanings. The appropriation of these words by the population as a method for describing their response to the variation in the environment provides the basis for the choice as target words for the study. The classification of the words as being positive versus negative lies in the direction provided by Frank Lutz. This politicization of a scientific word as a means of directing public awareness, means the prescription of one phrase (climate change) as being more positive than the other (global warming).\n",
            "\n",
            "Global warming is defined as the long-term trend of increasing average global temperatures; alternatively, climate change is defined as a change in global or regional climate patterns, in particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide arising from the use of fossil fuels. Therefore, the search keywords were chosen based on their scientific value and their public visibility. What is important about the choice of these search terms is that due to their scientific use, they describe a distinctly identifiable state. The more specific these words are, the less risk of the algorithm misinterpreting the keyword and thus having the results misinterpreted [34–36].\n",

            "The purpose of the following study was to identify trends within search parameters for two specific sets of trend queries. The second purpose of the study was to identify how the public responds emotionally to those same queries. Finally, the purpose of the study was to determine if the two had any connections.\n",
            "\n",
            "Public awareness of the terms climate change and global warming was identified using Google Trends (google.com/trends) and public databases of Google queries [37]. To specify the exact searches we used the two terms ‘climate change’ and ‘global warming’ as query phrases. Queries were normalized using relative search volume (RSV) to the period with the highest proportion of searches going to the focal terms (i.e. RSV = 100 is the period with the highest proportion for queries within a category and RSV = 50 when 50% of that is the highest search proportion). Two assumptions were necessary for this study. The first is, of the two terms, climate change and global warming, that which draws more search results is considered more interesting to the general population. The second assumption is that changes in keyword search patterns are indicators of the use of different forms of terminology used by the public. To analyze sentiments related to climate change and global warming, tweets containing acronyms for climate change and global warming were collected from Twitter API for the period from October 12 to December 12, 2013. A total of 21,182 and 26,462 tweets referencing the terms climate change and global warming were collected respectively. When duplicated tweets were identified, they were removed from the analysis. The remaining tweets totaled 8,465 (climate change) and 8,263 (global warming) were compiled for the sentiment analysis.\n",

            "In Twitter® comments are emotionally loaded, due to their textually shortened nature. Sentiment analysis, which is in effect opinion mining, is how opinions in texts are assessed, along with how they are expressed in terms of positive, neutral or negative content [36]. Nasukawa and Yi [10]state that sentiment analysis identifies statements of sentiment and classifies those statements based on their polarity and strength along with their relationship to the topic.\n",

            "Sentiment analysis was conducted using Semantria® software (www.semantria.com), which is available as an MS Excel spreadsheet application plugin. The plugin is broken into parts of speech (POS), the algorithm within the plugin then identifies sentiment-laden phrases and then scores them from -10 to 10 on a logarithmic scale, and finally the scores for each POS are tabulated to identify the final score for each phrase. The tweets are then via statistical inferences tagged with a numerical value from -2 to 2 and given a polarity, which is classified as positive, neutral or negative [36]. Semantria®, the program utilized for this study, has been used since 2011 to perform sentiment analyses [7, 22].\n",
            "\n",
            "For the analysis, an identity column was added to the dataset to enable analysis of individual tweets with respect to sentiment. A basic sentiment analysis was conducted on the dataset using the Semantria® plugin. The plugin uses a cloud based corpus of words tagged with sentimental connotations to analyze the dataset. Through statistical inference, each tweet is tagged with a sentiment value from -2 to +2 and a polarity of (i) negative, (ii) neutral, or (iii) positive. Positive nature increases with increasing positive sentiment. The nature of the language POS assignation is dependent upon the algorithmic classification parameters defined by the Semantria® program. Determining polarity for each POS is achieved using the relationship between the words as well as the words themselves. By assigning negative values to specific negative phrases, it limits the use of non-specific negation processes in language; however, the program has been trained to assess non-specific linguistic negations in context.\n",

            "A tweet term frequency dictionary was computed using the N-gram method from the corpus of climate change and global warming [38]. We used a combination of unigrams and bigrams, which has been reported to be effective [39]. Before using the N-gram method, typological symbols were removed using the open source code editor (i.e. Notepad) or Microsoft Words’ “Replace” function.\n",

            "Differences in RSV’s for the terms global warming and climate change for the investigation period were identified using a paired t-test. Pettitt and Mann-Kendall tests were used to identify changes in distribution, averages and the presence of trends within the weekly RSV’s. The Pettitt and MK tests, which assume a stepwise shift in the mean (a break point) and are sensitive to breaks in the middle of a time series, were applied to test for homogeneity in the data [40]. Temporal trends within the time series were analyzed with Spearman’s non-parametric correlation analysis. A paired t-test and Spearman’s non-parametric correlation analysis were conducted using SPSS software (version 17.0 SPSS In corp.

            "\n",
            "While we are seeing the increases and decreases in RSVs for both the terms global warming and climate change, the most notable changes occur when the gap between the terms was the greatest, from 2008 through to 2010. During this period, there was a very large gap found between the RSVs for the terms global warming and climate change; however, searches for the term climate change was increasing while searches for the tem global warming were decreasing. The counter movement of the RSV’s for the two terms shows that there is a trend happening with respect to term recognition. At this point, there was an increase in the use of the CC term while there was a corresponding decrease in the use of the GW term. The change in the use of the term could have been due to changes in the publicity of the respective terms, since at this point, the CC term was being used more visibly in the media, and therefore the CC term was showing up in headlines and the press, resulting in a larger number of searches for the CC term. Correspondingly, the decrease in the use of the GW term is likely due to the changes in how the term was perceived by the public. The public press determines how a term is used, since they are the body that consistently utilizes a term throughout its visible life. The two terms, regardless of how they differ in meaning, are used with purpose in a scientific context, yet the public at large lacks this definition and therefore has no knowledge of the variations in the terms themselves [42]. Therefore, when searching for a term, the public may very well, choose the search term that they are more comfortable with, resulting in a search bias, since they do not know the scientific use of the term.\n",
            "\n",
            "The increase in the use of the CC term, could be a direct result of the release of the fourth assessment report for the IPCC in 2007 [43]. The publicity related to the release of this document, which was preceded by the release of the Al Gore produced documentary “An Inconvenient Truth”, both of which were followed by the selection by the Nobel committee of Al Gore and the IPCC scientists for the Nobel Prize in 2007 [43]. These three acts individually may not have created the increased media presence of the CC term; however, at the time the three events pushed the CC term and increased its exposure to the public which further drove the public to push for positive environmental change at the political level [44, 45]. This could very well have resulted in the increases in RSV’s for the CC term. This point is more likely to depict accurately the situation, since in 2010 the use of the two terms decline at almost the same rate, with nearly the same patterns.\n",
            "\n",
            "Thus with respect to trend analysis, what is interesting is that RSVs are paralleling the press for specific environmental events that have predetermined value according to the press. The press in increasing the visibility of the term may drive the increases in the RSV’s for that term. Prior to 2007, the press was using the GW term indiscriminately whenever issues affecting the global climate arose; however, after the movie, the report and then the Nobel prize the terminology used by the press switched and the CC term became the word du jour. This increased the visibility of the word to the public, thereby it may be that increasing public awareness of the word, but not necessarily its import, is the source for the increases in RSV’s between 2008 and 2010.\n",
            "\n",
            "The decline in the RSV’s then is a product of the lack of publicity about the issue. As the terms become more familiar, there would be less necessity to drive the term publicly into the spotlight; however, occasionally events/situations arise that refocus the issue creating a resurgence in the terms even though they have reached their peak visibility between 2008 and 2010.\n",
            "\n",
            "These differences show that there is a perceptive difference in how the public relates to the two terms Global Warming and Climate Change [50, 51]. Climate change is shown in a more positive light than global warming simply based on the tweets produced by the public. The difference in how people perceive climate change and global warming is possibly due to the press, personal understanding of the terms, or level of education. While this in itself is indefinable, since by nature tweets are linguistically restrictive, the thing to take from it is that there is a measurable difference in how individuals respond to climatological changes that they are experiencing daily. These changes have a describable effect on how the population is responding to the publicity surrounding the two terms to the point where it can be used to manipulate governmental policy [52].\n",
            "\n",
            "Sentiment analysis is a tool that can be used to determine how the population feels about a topic; however, the nature of the algorithm makes it hard to effectively determine how this is being assessed. For the current study, the sentiment analysis showed that there was a greater negative association with the term global warming than with the term climate change. This difference, which while being an expression of individual like or dislike at the time the tweet was created, denotes that the two terms were either not understood in their true form, or that individuals may have a greater familiarity with one term over the other, which may be due to a longer exposure to the term (GW) or the negative press associated with the term (GW).\n",
            "\n",
            "Trend analysis identified that the public is aware of the terminology used to describe climatological variation. The terminology showed changes in use over time with global warming starting as the more well-known term, and then its use decreased over time. At the same time, the more definitive term climate change had less exposure early on; however, with the increase of press exposure, the public became increasingly aware of the term and its more accurate definition. This increase appeared to be correspondent with the increasing publicity around three very powerful press exposure events (a documentary, a scientific report release and a Nobel Prize). The more the term was used the more people came to use it, this included searches on the internet.\n",
            "\n",
            "Comparatively sentiment analysis showed that the two terms had differential expressions in the population. With climate change being seen in a more positive frame than global warming. The use of sentiment analysis as a tool to evaluate how the population is responding to a feature is an important tool. However, it is a tool that measures, it does not define.\n",
            "\n",
            "Social network systems and internet searches are effective tools in identifying changes in both public awareness and public perception of an issue. However, in and of itself, these are bell ringers they can be used to determine the importance of an issue, but not the rationale behind the why it is important. This is an important fact to remember when using analytical tools that evaluate social network systems and their use by the public.\n",

However, searching the internet falls into two patterns, searches for work or for personal interest, neither of which can be determined from the trend engines. The By following the searches, it is possible to determine the range of public interest in the two terms, based on the respective volumes of the search queries. Previously in order to mine public opinion on a subject, government agencies had to revert to polling and surveys, which while being effective did not cover a very large component of the population [15–17].\n",
            "\n",
            "Google trend data is one method of measuring popularity of a subject within the population. Individuals searching for a topic use search keywords to obtain the desired information [5, 18]. These keywords are topic sensitive, and therefore indicate the level of knowledge regarding the searched topic. The two primary word phrases here “climate change” and “global warming” are unilateral terms that indicate a level of awareness about the issue which is indicative of the individuals interest in that subject [5, 19, 20]. Google trend data relates how often a term is searched, that is the frequency of a search term can be identified from the results of the Google® trend analysis. While frequency is not a direct measure of popularity, it does indicate if a search term is common or uncommon and the value of that term to the public at large. The relationship between frequency and popularity lies in the volume of searches by a large number of individuals over specific time duration. Therefore, by identifying the number of searches during a specific period, it is possible to come to a proximate understanding of how popular or common a term is for the general population [21]. However, the use of trend data is more appropriately used to identify awareness of an issue rather than its popularity.\n",
            "\n",
            "This brings us to sentiment analysis. Part of the connection between the search and the populations’ awareness of an issue can be measured using how they refer to the subject in question. This sentiment, is found in different forms of social media, or social networking sites sites i.e. twitter®, Facebook®, linked in® and personal blogs [7, 22–24]. Thus, the original information, which was found on the internet, becomes influenced by personal attitudes and opinions [25]and then redistributed throughout the internet, accessible to anyone who has an internet connection and the desire to search. This behavior affects the information that now provides the opportunity to assess public sentiment regarding the prevailing attitudes regarding environmental issues [26, 27]. To assess this we used Google® and Twitter® data to understand public concerns related to climate change and global warming. Google trend was used to trace changes in interest between the two phenomena. Tweets (comments made on Twitter®) were analyzed to identify negative or positive emotional responses.\n",
            "\n",
            "Comparatively, twitter data is more indicative of how people refer to topics of interest [28–31], in a manner that is very linguistically restricted. As well, twitter is used as a platform for verbal expression of emotional responses. Due to the restrictions on tweet size (each tweet can only be 140 characters in length), it is necessary to be more direct in dealing with topics of interest to the tweeter. Therefore, the tweets are linguistically more emotionally charged and can be used to define a level of emotional response by the tweeter.\n",
            "\n",
            "The choice of target words for the tweets and for the Google trend searches were the specific topic phrases [32, 33]. These were chosen because of the descriptive nature of the phrases. Scientific literature is very specific in its use and therefore has very definitive meanings. The appropriation of these words by the population as a method for describing their response to the variation in the environment provides the basis for the choice as target words for the study. The classification of the words as being positive versus negative lies in the direction provided by Frank Lutz. This politicization of a scientific word as a means of directing public awareness, means the prescription of one phrase (climate change) as being more positive than the other (global warming).\n",
            "\n",
            "Global warming is defined as the long-term trend of increasing average global temperatures; alternatively, climate change is defined as a change in global or regional climate patterns, in particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide arising from the use of fossil fuels. Therefore, the search keywords were chosen based on their scientific value and their public visibility. What is important about the choice of these search terms is that due to their scientific use, they describe a distinctly identifiable state. The more specific these words are, the less risk of the algorithm misinterpreting the keyword and thus having the results misinterpreted [34–36].\n",

            "The purpose of the following study was to identify trends within search parameters for two specific sets of trend queries. The second purpose of the study was to identify how the public responds emotionally to those same queries. Finally, the purpose of the study was to determine if the two had any connections.\n",

            "Public awareness of the terms climate change and global warming was identified using Google Trends (google.com/trends) and public databases of Google queries [37]. To specify the exact searches we used the two terms ‘climate change’ and ‘global warming’ as query phrases. Queries were normalized using relative search volume (RSV) to the period with the highest proportion of searches going to the focal terms (i.e. RSV = 100 is the period with the highest proportion for queries within a category and RSV = 50 when 50% of that is the highest search proportion). Two assumptions were necessary for this study. The first is, of the two terms, climate change and global warming, that which draws more search results is considered more interesting to the general population. The second assumption is that changes in keyword search patterns are indicators of the use of different forms of terminology used by the public. To analyze sentiments related to climate change and global warming, tweets containing acronyms for climate change and global warming were collected from Twitter API for the period from October 12 to December 12, 2013. A total of 21,182 and 26,462 tweets referencing the terms climate change and global warming were collected respectively. When duplicated tweets were identified, they were removed from the analysis. The remaining tweets totaled 8,465 (climate change) and 8,263 (global warming) were compiled for the sentiment analysis.\n",

            "Sentiment analysis was conducted using Semantria® software (www.semantria.com), which is available as an MS Excel spreadsheet application plugin. The plugin is broken into parts of speech (POS), the algorithm within the plugin then identifies sentiment-laden phrases and then scores them from -10 to 10 on a logarithmic scale, and finally the scores for each POS are tabulated to identify the final score for each phrase. The tweets are then via statistical inferences tagged with a numerical value from -2 to 2 and given a polarity, which is classified as positive, neutral or negative [36]. Semantria®, the program utilized for this study, has been used since 2011 to perform sentiment analyses [7, 22].\n",

            "For the analysis, an identity column was added to the dataset to enable analysis of individual tweets with respect to sentiment. A basic sentiment analysis was conducted on the dataset using the Semantria® plugin. The plugin uses a cloud based corpus of words tagged with sentimental connotations to analyze the dataset. Through statistical inference, each tweet is tagged with a sentiment value from -2 to +2 and a polarity of (i) negative, (ii) neutral, or (iii) positive. Positive nature increases with increasing positive sentiment. The nature of the language POS assignation is dependent upon the algorithmic classification parameters defined by the Semantria® program. Determining polarity for each POS is achieved using the relationship between the words as well as the words themselves. By assigning negative values to specific negative phrases, it limits the use of non-specific negation processes in language; however, the program has been trained to assess non-specific linguistic negations in context.\n",

The Pettitt and MK tests, which assume a stepwise shift in the mean (a break point) and are sensitive to breaks in the middle of a time series, were applied to test for homogeneity in the data [40]. Temporal trends within the time series were analyzed with Spearman’s non-parametric correlation analysis.

Although the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published its Fourth Assessment Report in 2007 and was awarded the Nobel Prize, interest in the term global warming as used in internet searches has decreased significantly since 2010 (K = 51493, t = 2010-May-23, P<0.001). Further the change in RSV also been indicative of the decreased pattern (Kendall’s tau = -0.336, S = -44563, P<0.001). The use of the term “climate change” has risen marginally since 2006 (K = 38681, t = 2006-Oct-08, P<0.001), as indicated by a slight increase (Kendall’s tau = -0.07, S = 9068, P<0.001). These findings show that the difference in usage of the two terms climate change and global warming has recently been reduced.\n",

            "The sentiment analysis of tweets (Fig 2) shows that people felt more negative about the term global warming (sentiment index = -0.21±0.34) than climate change (-0.068±0.36). Global warming tweets reflecting negative sentiments via descriptions such as, “bad, fail, crazy, afraid and catastrophe,” represented 52.1% of the total number of tweets. As an example, the tweet, “Supposed to snow here in the a.m.! OMG. So sick of already, but Saturday says 57 WTF!” had the lowest score at -1.8. Another observation was that 40.7% of tweets, including “agree, recommend, rescue, hope, and contribute,” were regarded as neutral. While 7.2% of tweets conveyed positive messages such as, “good, accept, interesting, and truth.” One positive global warming tweet, read, “So if we didn’t have global warming, would all this rain be snow!”. The results from the Pearson’s chi-square analysis showed that the relationship between the variables was significant (Pearson’s chi-square –763.98, d.f. = 2, P<0.001).

            "Understandably, global warming and climate change are the terms used most frequently to describe each phenomenon, respectively, as revealed by the N-gram analysis (Table 1). When people tweeted about global warming, they repeatedly used associated such as, “ice, snow, Arctic, and sea.” In contrast, tweets referring to climate change commonly used, “report, IPCC, world, science, environment, and scientist.” People seem to think that climate change as a phenomenon is revealed by scientific investigation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Internet searches are one way of understanding the popularity of an idea or meme within the public at large. Within that frame of reference, the public looks at these two terms global warming and climate change and their awareness of the roles of the two phenomena [41]. From 2004 to 2008, the search volumes for the term global warming far exceeded the term climate change. The range for the term global warming in Relative search volumes (RSV) was more than double that of climate change in this period (Fig 1). From 2008 on the RSV’s began to steadily decrease until in 2014 when the RSV’s for the term global warming were nearly identical to those for the term climate change. From 2008 there was an increase in the RSVs for CC until 2010 at which point the RSVs also began to decline for the term climate change. The decline in the term climate change for the most part paralleled that of the term global warming from 2010 on to the present.\n",
            "\n",
            "While we are seeing the increases and decreases in RSVs for both the terms global warming and climate change, the most notable changes occur when the gap between the terms was the greatest, from 2008 through to 2010. During this period, there was a very large gap found between the RSVs for the terms global warming and climate change; however, searches for the term climate change was increasing while searches for the tem global warming were decreasing. The counter movement of the RSV’s for the two terms shows that there is a trend happening with respect to term recognition. At this point, there was an increase in the use of the CC term while there was a corresponding decrease in the use of the GW term. The change in the use of the term could have been due to changes in the publicity of the respective terms, since at this point, the CC term was being used more visibly in the media, and therefore the CC term was showing up in headlines and the press, resulting in a larger number of searches for the CC term. Correspondingly, the decrease in the use of the GW term is likely due to the changes in how the term was perceived by the public. The public press determines how a term is used, since they are the body that consistently utilizes a term throughout its visible life. The two terms, regardless of how they differ in meaning, are used with purpose in a scientific context, yet the public at large lacks this definition and therefore has no knowledge of the variations in the terms themselves [42]. Therefore, when searching for a term, the public may very well, choose the search term that they are more comfortable with, resulting in a search bias, since they do not know the scientific use of the term.\n",
            "\n",
            "The increase in the use of the CC term, could be a direct result of the release of the fourth assessment report for the IPCC in 2007 [43]. The publicity related to the release of this document, which was preceded by the release of the Al Gore produced documentary “An Inconvenient Truth”, both of which were followed by the selection by the Nobel committee of Al Gore and the IPCC scientists for the Nobel Prize in 2007 [43]. These three acts individually may not have created the increased media presence of the CC term; however, at the time the three events pushed the CC term and increased its exposure to the public which further drove the public to push for positive environmental change at the political level [44, 45]. This could very well have resulted in the increases in RSV’s for the CC term. This point is more likely to depict accurately the situation, since in 2010 the use of the two terms decline at almost the same rate, with nearly the same patterns.\n",
            "\n",
            "Thus with respect to trend analysis, what is interesting is that RSVs are paralleling the press for specific environmental events that have predetermined value according to the press. The press in increasing the visibility of the term may drive the increases in the RSV’s for that term. Prior to 2007, the press was using the GW term indiscriminately whenever issues affecting the global climate arose; however, after the movie, the report and then the Nobel prize the terminology used by the press switched and the CC term became the word du jour. This increased the visibility of the word to the public, thereby it may be that increasing public awareness of the word, but not necessarily its import, is the source for the increases in RSV’s between 2008 and 2010.\n",
            "\n",
            "The decline in the RSV’s then is a product of the lack of publicity about the issue. As the terms become more familiar, there would be less necessity to drive the term publicly into the spotlight; however, occasionally events/situations arise that refocus the issue creating a resurgence in the terms even though they have reached their peak visibility between 2008 and 2010.\n",
            "\n",
            "Since these terms have such an impact on the daily lives of the public via local regional national and global weather it is understandable that they have an emotional component to them [46]. Every country has its jokes about the weather, where they come up with cliché’s about the weather (i.e. if you don’t like the weather wait 10minutes) that often show their discord and disjunction with natural climatological patterns [47]. Furthermore, some sectors of society (farmers) have a direct relationship with the climate and their means of living; bad weather is equal to bad harvests, which means less money. To understand how society represents this love hate relationship with the weather, the twitter analysis was performed. Twitter, a data restricted social network system, has a limited character count to relay information about any topic the sender chooses to relate. These tweets can be used to assess the sentiment of the sender towards a certain topic. As stated previously, the sentiment is defined by the language of the tweet within the twitter system. Sentiment analysis showed that the two terms differed greatly. Based on the predefined algorithm for the sentiment analysis, certain language components carried a positive sentiment, while others carried a negative sentiment. Tweets about GW and CC were subdivided based on their positive, neutral and negative connotations within the tweet network. These emotions regardless of their character still play a role in how humans interacts with surroundings including other humans [48, 49] As seen in Fig 2 the different terms had similar distributions, although with different ranges in the values. Global warming showed a much smaller positive tweet value than did climate change. Correspondent to this the respective percentage of positive sentiments for CC was more than double that of GW. Comparatively, the neutral percentiles were more similar for each term with a small difference. However, the negative sentiments for the two terms again showed a greater disparity, with negative statements about GW nearly double those of climate change.\n",
            "\n",
            "These differences show that there is a perceptive difference in how the public relates to the two terms Global Warming and Climate Change [50, 51]. Climate change is shown in a more positive light than global warming simply based on the tweets produced by the public. The difference in how people perceive climate change and global warming is possibly due to the press, personal understanding of the terms, or level of education. While this in itself is indefinable, since by nature tweets are linguistically restrictive, the thing to take from it is that there is a measurable difference in how individuals respond to climatological changes that they are experiencing daily. These changes have a describable effect on how the population is responding to the publicity surrounding the two terms to the point where it can be used to manipulate governmental policy [52].\n",
            "\n",
            "Sentiment analysis is a tool that can be used to determine how the population feels about a topic; however, the nature of the algorithm makes it hard to effectively determine how this is being assessed. For the current study, the sentiment analysis showed that there was a greater negative association with the term global warming than with the term climate change. This difference, which while being an expression of individual like or dislike at the time the tweet was created, denotes that the two terms were either not understood in their true form, or that individuals may have a greater familiarity with one term over the other, which may be due to a longer exposure to the term (GW) or the negative press associated with the term (GW).\n",
            "\n",
            "Trend analysis identified that the public is aware of the terminology used to describe climatological variation. The terminology showed changes in use over time with global warming starting as the more well-known term, and then its use decreased over time. At the same time, the more definitive term climate change had less exposure early on; however, with the increase of press exposure, the public became increasingly aware of the term and its more accurate definition. This increase appeared to be correspondent with the increasing publicity around three very powerful press exposure events (a documentary, a scientific report release and a Nobel Prize). The more the term was used the more people came to use it, this included searches on the internet.\n",
            "\n",
            "Comparatively sentiment analysis showed that the two terms had differential expressions in the population. With climate change being seen in a more positive frame than global warming. The use of sentiment analysis as a tool to evaluate how the population is responding to a feature is an important tool. However, it is a tool that measures, it does not define.\n",
            "\n",
            "Social network systems and internet searches are effective tools in identifying changes in both public awareness and public perception of an issue. However, in and of itself, these are bell ringers they can be used to determine the importance of an issue, but not the rationale behind the why it is important. This is an important fact to remember when using analytical tools that evaluate social network systems and their use by the public.\n",

            "The increasing prevalence of social networks provides researchers greater opportunities to evaluate and assess changes in public opinion and public sentiment towards issues of social consequence. Using trend and sentiment analysis is one method whereby researchers can identify changes in public perception that can be used to enhance the development of a social consciousness towards a specific public interest. The following study assessed Relative search volume (RSV) patterns for global warming (GW) and Climate change (CC) to determine public knowledge and awareness of these terms. In conjunction with this, the researchers looked at the sentiment connected to these terms in social media networks. It was found that there was a relationship between the awareness of the information and the amount of publicity generated around the terminology. Furthermore, the primary driver for the increase in awareness was an increase in publicity in either a positive or a negative light. Sentiment analysis further confirmed that the primary emotive connections to the words were derived from the original context in which the word was framed. Thus having awareness or knowledge of a topic is strongly related to its public exposure in the media, and the emotional context of this relationship is dependent on the context in which the relationship was originally established. This has value in fields like conservation, law enforcement, or other fields where the practice can and often does have two very strong emotive responses based on the context of the problems being examined.\n",

            "For example, the term ‘climate change’, while scientifically accurate, doesn’t necessarily communicate that regular people actually need to do anything. “Just because something is changing, it doesn’t mean it requires any action from me. That doesn’t signal action,” he explains.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Changing the way we talk about climate change is key to getting people to act,” says Dr Dann Mitchell, associate professor in atmospheric science at the University of Bristol.\n",
            "\n",
            "He highlights the discussion of global average temperatures as an example where this is particularly important. “If you were to get in a bath that was 0.2°C warmer than it was when you got in the same bath 10 years ago, you wouldn’t care, or even know. But for the Earth-system as a whole, this small temperature change has huge repercussions, because it can be significantly amplified at local levels.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The term ‘global warming’ could be considered misleading, says van der Linden, because the effects are far broader than just warming temperatures, and also include flooding and a loss of wildlife.\n",
            "\n",
            "“On the one hand, people are saying that global warming is more emotive and can be more persuasive,” van der Linden explains. “On the other hand, it might miss out on getting people concerned about the whole range of impacts.”\n",
            "\n",
            "In medicine, it is well known that language strongly influences patients’ feelings about a particular procedure or illness. “If you frame something to a patient as probability of death versus survival, even though the probability is the same in both scenarios, people have very different responses to that, just based on the wording,” says van der Linden.\n",
            "\n",
            "This framing effect can be harnessed to encourage people to take more environmentally friendly actions. In a 2008 paper, social psychologist Noah J Goldstein and team investigated whether guests at a hotel were more likely to reuse their towels based on how the request was framed.\n",
            "\n",
            "If the guests were told to ‘help save the environment’ by reusing towels, then 35 per cent of them took part. This rose to 44 per cent reusing their towels when told that the majority of guests already did. This number increased to 49 per cent if they were told that the majority of guests who had stayed in the same room as them took part.\n",
            "\n",
            "How we talk about the climate seems to matter when it comes to influencing others. Speaking to 6,000 Americans, van der Linden’s own research found that explaining the idea of scientific consensus, in a clear and simple manner, significantly changed their beliefs about climate change and even affected how worried they were about it.\n",
            "\n",
            "Climate change language has changed before. A South Korean paper studied over 40,000 tweets containing the terms ‘global warming’ and ‘climate change’, spanning from 2004 to 2015. The researchers found that, over time, ‘global warming’ had gradually become less popular, with ‘climate change’ taking its place.\n",
            "\n",
            "What term you should use depends on the context, and what you’re trying to get across. Mitchell believes that while ‘climate crisis’ might be appropriate for a publication like The Guardian, as a climate researcher, he should only use impartial language.\n",
            "\n",
            "“‘Anthropogenic climate change’ is about the only term I use, often just shortened to ‘climate change’,” he explains. “As a scientist, accurate scientific terminology is always our only choice. So, while the term ‘climate crisis’ seems not quite right, it is clear why it is being used, and frankly I don’t think a word exists for exactly what type of emergency this is.”\n",
            "\n",
            "When it comes to communicating with the public, however, it’s important to choose terms that invoke the right emotions. Namely, people need to be worried.\n",
            "\n",
            "“[Worry] is an active emotional state in which people cognitively engage in thinking about a problem and how they might avoid it, versus fear, which is more of a paralysing emotion,” says van der Linden. So, the ideal term conveys a sense of both urgency and optimism, and not a sense of doom.\n",
            "\n",
            "‘Climate crisis’ is van der Linden’s choice, at least of the ones he has heard so far. “Global meltdown, I think, sounds too catastrophic. Chaos is not something people like. Chaos is uncontrolled,” he says. “I think ‘climate crisis’ signals an urgency. People don’t like crises either, but people know that crises can be avoided and that they can be resolved.”\n",

            "(Continued) By the end of the 1970s, scientific opinion had settled on warming             as most likely, probably becoming evident around the year 2000 —             which at that point lay in a remote and uncertain future. Some scientists nevertheless             went directly to the public to demand action to avert the warming, and             a few politicians took up the issue. During the hot summer of 1988, a             few outspoken scientists, convinced by new evidence that rapid climate             change might be imminent, made the public fully aware of the problem.             Scientific discussions now became entangled with fierce political debates             over the costs of regulating greenhouse gases. Corporations and conservatives spent large sums to sow uncertainty and denial of any danger from global warming.             It was not until around 2005 that American media reported clearly that             scientists had resolved the controversy, while films and ominous weather             events gave citizens a better idea of what global warming might mean.             The majority of Americans had moved gradually             to a vague feeling that some kind of action should be taken. But the issue became increasingly politicized; on the right, doubt and  denial increased. Stronger worries meanwhile grew  among people in most other countries.

            "The fires  of public interest were stoked                   by Congressional hearings, promoted especially by Albert Gore, who                   had taken an early interest in the topic. Still more newsworthy                   was a controversy that broke out in 1983 when the Environmental                   Protection Agency (EPA) issued a report declaring that the future                   temperature rise could be catastrophic. As the New York Times                   noted in a front-page story, the EPA report was the first time a                   Federal agency had declared that global warming was \"not a                   theoretical problem but a threat whose effects will be felt within                   a few years.\" Within decades, the Times suggested,                    food production could suffer. That stood in stark contradiction to a soothing report that the National Academy                   of Sciences  issued just days later. According to this report,                   as Sullivan summarized it in a Times editorial, \"the greenhouse               effect is for real but we can live with it.\"\n",

            "After the spate of global warming stories in the summer of 1988,                             media attention inevitably declined as more normal weather set in.                             As noted above, even for a potential danger, readers                             will become discouraged or simply bored when nothing immediate is                             done, and editors will look for something novel to fill their \"news hole.\" Besides, the winter of 1989 was a particularly                                 cold one, and people tend to take their cue fromt he most recent few months of weather. The climate change story also lacked an interesting enemy,                                 a villain (other than ourselves) dito blame for the world's woes.(112) But even if an issue is no longer                                 in the forefront of everyone's mind, it can remain present. Although                                 press coverage of global warming sank after its peak in the summer                                 of 1988, it now fluctuated around a much higher average level than                               in the early 1980s.(113)\n",

            "Even more newsworthy                   was the international Kyoto Climate Conference, scheduled for December                   1997. Here was where national governments would make real economic and political                   decisions on the use of fossil fuels. The administration of President                   Bill Clinton made a bid for public support for a treaty, holding                   a well-publicized conference of experts on climate change in October.                   Editors saw a story line of conflict developing as they anticipated                   the Conference. News reports were further stimulated by advertising                   campaigns and other intense public relations efforts, funded by                   environmental organizations on the one hand, by the Global Climate                   Coalition of industrial corporations on the other. Television stories                   dealing with global warming jumped from a mere dozen in July-September                   to well over 200 in October-December. Surveys conducted around the                   time of the meeting found about ten percent of the American public                   saying they followed the global warming news \"very closely,\"                   a substantial fraction for such an issue (for more exciting stories, like a celebrity scandal,                   the fraction could be several times higher). Most of the news items                   asserted that global warming was underway, with barely a tenth including                   any expression of doubt.\n",

            "Reports of                   official studies by scientific panels each had                   their day in the limelight, but rarely more than a day. Stories                   made more of an impression if they dealt with something visible,                   as when ice floes the size of a small nation split off from                    Antarctic ice shelves.(134) Other chances to mention global climate change came in                   stories about heat waves, floods, and coastal storms, especially                   when the events were more damaging than anything in recent memory.                   Citizens who attended more closely would see stories about shifts                   in the range of species, from birds and butterflies to insects pests                   and diseases. The concerns were largely parochial. Media in the                   United States would scarcely notice a record-breaking heat wave                   or flood that stirred up fears of global warming in Europe, and vice versa.(135)\n",

            "Many people in these focus groups were convinced that not only                   climate changes but all environmental harms were the fault of social                   decline  a rising tide of selfishness, gluttony and corruption.                   (In one week of unusual warmth during November 1989, I heard two                   people separately say that the Earth was paying us back for the                   harm we humans were doing to it.) People saw climate change through the filter of their world-views about how nature works, what makes for a fair society, and so forth, views that they had developed since childhood. Many thought first of a generalized \"pollution,\"                   the material and moral evils intertwined.  Belief in an all-powerful God had a major influence. Some believers,  including prominent                   scientists, wondered if we had invited divine retribution. Most                   Americans believed they were personally powerless to change  the prevailing morality and society, and therefore saw the problem of global warming as                   insoluble. Anxious and baffled, \"people literally don't like to                   think or talk about the subject,\" the authors of the 1998 study concluded.                   \"Their concern translates into frustration rather than support for action.\" Later studies found much the same.

            "As often happens               with such issues, after the wave of attention surged forward it receded:               The number of media reports on global warming fell almost as fast               during 2008 as it had risen during 2006.  This was a common feature of long-running stories such as those involving the environment. After a while other issues of the moment would arise and capture the attention of media and the public, an \"issue-attention cycle.\" Any shift in  economic and political problems would push environmental concerns out of the limelight.Polls of Americans in 2009               found that they had grown a bit less concerned about global               warming.  One probable reason was the “finite pool of worry.” With the worst economic recession in two generations underway, people were preoccupied with immediate problems.(152a)\n",

            "Good scientists take their time; they understand that at the frontier of what is known, no finding can be trusted until it has been confirmed by other findings, a laboriously slow process. The news media, however, naturally featured the latest results. Hurricanes were increasing!...oops, no they weren't! The oceans were warming! ...no, they were cooling! ...oops,             they really were warming! Small wonder if many citizens  in the early 2000s believed concluded that climate science was unreliable.\n",

            "Nobody escaped the drumbeat of scientific reports on diminishing ice and advancing temperatures, or the accounts of exceptional heat waves, floods and droughts around the world. The media captured audiences with gripping visuals of terrifying wildfires in North America and Australia and gigantic storms in every tropical sea. News reporters began to notice the scientists who were attributing damage from a particular weather catastrophe to global warming. Nearly all television weather reporters now accepted the scientists' consensus, and many had begun to talk to their audiences about climate change. In the five years 2017-2021 the fraction of Americans who said they were seriously \"alarmed\" by global warming rose from 18% to 33% of the adult population. For the first time the issue played a significant role in American electoral politics as  presidential candidates debated climate policies at length. To be sure, climate was only one of many issues people worried about (jobs, health care, crime...), and for a large majority of the public it was far from the top of the list.\n",

            "Uncertainty about science was part of a general mistrust of all elites and institutions that had been spreading steadily since the 1960s. The attitude was reflected in a 2021 movie, \"Don.'t Look Up,\" which the creators publicized as a response to the climate danger— the first widely seen and widely discussed such movie since 2004. What audiences actually got was a dark satire damning the idiocy of media, industry and government all together.(160*)\n",

Normally an urgent fact, for example an enemy who threatens to devastate a city, or a hurricane that actually does so, will mobilize citizens to unite in common effort. Scientists had expected at first that global warming would do just that. Tragically, the nature of modern public discourse, and the interests that drove it, led in a different direction.\n",

In 2000 Patrick Michaels claimed that time had shown Hansen's 1988 prediction             of temperature increase was exaggerated by 450%, a claim later picked             up by novelist Michael Crichton and others. In fact Hansen had presented             three scenarios, including a worst-case one  (accelerating emissions including CFCs, etc.) and two more-likely             ones. Michaels et al. spoke only of the worst-case scenario and did not             mention Hansen's middle scenario, which came closest to the actual rise of greenhouse gases. The prediction for this scenario tracked the global temperature rise to 2005,  ran well ahead. In the 2010s critics claimed the discrepancy showed all modeling was faulty, but after 2015 global temperatures rose close to Hansen's decades-old prediction. It was a remarkable success given the relatively rudimentary computer power and understanding of atmospheric processes available in the 1980s.

            "(Continued from previous page)           By the end of the 1970s, scientific opinion had settled on warming           as most likely, probably becoming evident around the year 2000 —           which at that point lay in a remote and uncertain future. Some scientists nevertheless           went directly to the public to demand action to avert the warming, and           a few politicians took up the issue. During the hot summer of 1988, a           few outspoken scientists, convinced by new evidence that rapid climate           change might be imminent, made the public fully aware of the problem.           Scientific discussions now became entangled with fierce political debates           over the costs of regulating greenhouse gases. Corporations and conservatives spent large sums to sow uncertainty and denial of any danger from global warming.           It was not until around 2005 that American media reported clearly that           scientists had resolved the controversy, while films and ominous weather           events gave citizens a better idea of what global warming might mean.           The majority of Americans had moved gradually           to a vague feeling that some kind of action should be taken. But the issue became increasingly politicized; on the right, doubt and  denial increased. Stronger worries meanwhile grew  among people in most other countries.

            "Among climate scientists, concern continued to rise in the early and mid                 1980s. Computer models of the climate were rapidly improving and                 winning the trust of experts. The modelers now said they were quite                 confident that a global warming of several degrees would come within                 the 21st century. To an ordinary citizen, a change of a few degrees                 might sound trivial. But the scientists understood that it was serious,                 and science journalists passed along their predictions of sea-level                 rise and other problems. (Later research confirmed the predictions.                 For example, a 2004 study calculated that a rise of 3°C sustained                 over centuries would suffice to melt the Greenland ice cap and put                 the world’s coastal cities deep under water.) \"Gloomsday Predictions                 Have No Fault\" was how Science magazine summarized the                 report of one authoritative review panel. The report was noticed                 even by the New York Times, although only deep on an inside               page.(76)\n",
            "\n",
            "The fires  of public interest were stoked                 by Congressional hearings (promoted especially by Albert Gore, who                 had taken an early interest in the topic). Still more newsworthy                 was a controversy that broke out in 1983 when the Environmental                 Protection Agency (EPA) issued a report declaring that the future                 temperature rise could be catastrophic. As the New York Times                 noted in a front-page story, the EPA report was the first time a                 Federal agency had declared that global warming was \"not a                 theoretical problem but a threat whose effects will be felt within                 a few years.\" Within decades, the Times suggested,                 the sea level might rise and food production could suffer. That stood in stark contradiction to a soothing report that the National Academy                 of Sciences  issued just days later. According to this report,                 as Sullivan summarized it in a Times editorial, \"the greenhouse             effect is for real but we can live with it.\"\n",

            "Many journalists responded by presenting the issue as if it were                 a quarrel between two diametrically opposed groups of scientists.                 Reporters often sought an artificial balance by matching \"pro\"                 with \"anti\" scientists, one against one.  Publications that reported climate science news of ominous developments were hounded by angry letters to the editor demanding that the contrary view, denying global warming as a problem, should get equal time. A study of major                 U.S. newspapers found that up to 1994, climate scientists who were                 highly respected by their peers were cited considerably more frequently                 than the skeptics associated with conservative think tanks, but                 after 1995, as the conservatives grew more active, newspapers cited                 the two groups about equally. A similar shift was noted in the United Kingdom in the early 1990s: climate scientists lost control of the issue.(126)\n",
            "\n",
            "Even more newsworthy                 was the international Kyoto Climate Conference, scheduled for December                 1997. Here was where governments would make real economic and political                 decisions on the use of fossil fuels. The administration of President                 Bill Clinton made a bid for public support for a treaty, holding                 a well-publicized conference of experts on climate change in October.                 Editors saw a story line of conflict developing as they anticipated                 the Conference. News reports were further stimulated by advertising                 campaigns and other intense public relations efforts, funded by                 environmental organizations on the one hand, by the Global Climate                 Coalition of industrial corporations on the other. Television stories                 dealing with global warming jumped from a mere dozen in July-September                 to well over 200 in October-December. Surveys conducted around the                 time of the meeting found about ten percent of the American public                 saying they followed the global warming news \"very closely,\"                 a substantial fraction for such an issue (for more exciting stories,                 the fraction could be several times higher). Most of the news items                 asserted that global warming was underway, with barely a tenth including                 any expression of doubt.\n",

            "Reports of                 official studies by government or international panels each had                 their day in the limelight, but rarely more than a day. Stories                 made more of an impression if they dealt with something visible,                 as when ice floes the size of a small nation split off from the                 Antarctic ice shelves.(134) Other chances to mention global climate change came in                 stories about heat waves, floods, and coastal storms, especially                 when the events were more damaging than anything in recent memory.                 Citizens who attended more closely would see stories about shifts                 in the range of species, from birds and butterflies to insects pests                 and diseases. The concerns were largely parochial. Media in the                 United States would scarcely notice a record-breaking heat wave                 or flood that stirred up fears of global warming in Europe, and vice versa.(135)\n",
            "\n",
            "In fact, weather is so variable that any one of the widely reported                 incidents might have had nothing to do with global warming. Yet                 for symbolically conveying what scientists knew, the incidents could                 be truer than any dry array of data. For example, when tourists                 who visited the North Pole in August 2000 told reporters that they                 had found open water instead of ice, news stories claimed that this                 was the first time the Pole had been ice-free in millions of years.                 That was dead wrong  yet by many measures the Arctic Ocean                 icepack was in fact thinning rapidly. Similarly, a few years later,                 the announcement that the fabled snows of Kilimanjaro were vanishing                 turned the mountain into a renowned icon of global warming. A few                 critics argued that the main cause was a drought that brought less                 snow, but the general lesson was still correct  there was                 no doubt that nearly all of the world's mountain glaciers and icecaps                 were shrinking, and the only plausible explanation was global warming.(135a*) Or \"climate change\" — a phrase that was becoming more common than \"global warming;\" it included changes such as increases in floods, snowstorms, and other weather events that might be influenced by greenhouse gas emissions, but it also included normal, non-anthropogenic, climate changes.(136*)\n",
            "\n",
            "Most journalists continued to pursue their ideal of \"unbiased\"                 coverage by writing \"balanced\" stories that presented                 both sides of an issue. That put them in the odd situation of including,                 in a story that might describe years of research by teams with dozens                 of experts, a  response by one of the few scientists who                 still denied the existence of human-caused  global warming). Publicists for conservative and fossil-fuel                 organizations worked hard to give an impression that the denying                 scientists were a large and important minority. For example, Seitz and the Marshall Institute circulated a petition,               accompanied by a warming-denying review formatted to look like an article               printed in the prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,               and claimed to have gathered 15,000 signatures. The Academy took the               unprecedented step of announcing that it was not associated with the               activity of its former president, and inspection showed that very               few of the signatures belonged to people who had any expertise in               the science of climate change.\n",
            "\n",
            "Many people in these focus groups were convinced that not only                 climate changes but all environmental harms were the fault of social                 decline  a rising tide of selfishness, gluttony and corruption.                 (In one week of unusual warmth during November 1989, I heard two                 people separately say that the Earth was paying us back for the                 harm we humans were doing to it.) People saw climate change through the filter of their world-views about how nature works, what makes for a fair society, and so forth, views that they had developed since childhood. Many thought first of a generalized \"pollution,\"                 the material and moral evils intertwined.  Belief in an all-powerful God had a major influence. Some believers,  including prominent                 scientists, wondered if we had invited divine retribution. Most                 Americans believed they were personally powerless to change morality and society, and therefore saw the problem of global warming as                 insoluble. Anxious and baffled, \"people literally don't like to                 think or talk about the subject,\" the authors of the 1998 study (like later studies) concluded.                 \"Their concern translates into frustration rather than support for action.\"(143c)\n",
            "\n",
            "This was in line with a proliferation of Websites and blogs that                vehemently denounced the scientific consensus on global warming, usually from a right-wing standpoint. Some writers were supported by conservative think tanks, but others were  independent  citizens — denial was taking on a life of its own.   Meanwhile there was a rapidly growing stock of books with titles like Hot Talk, Cold Science: Global Warming's Unfinished Debate (by Singer) and The Skeptical Environmentalist (by an economist, Bjørn Lomborg).  Often supported by right-wing funds but increasingly including self-published works, these books, along with the Websites and blogs, passed around detailed warming-denial arguments supported by scraps of anomalous data. There are always anomalies at the research front,                of course. But when scientists resolved a problem the deniers                fastened on a newer one, while the old disproved arguments stubbornly lived                on among the Web's countless niches. The deniers had constructed                what one neutral observer called an \"alternative universe\"                where \"basic findings of mainstream science are rejected or                ignored.\"(147a)\n",
            "\n",
            "One important reason for the                 change was the disastrous summer of 2005, the worst Atlantic hurricane                 season on record, capped by Hurricane Katrina’s devastation                 of New Orleans. Attention to climate change in the American press                 climbed to the highest level ever. \"Are We Making Hurricanes                 Worse?\" asked the October 3 cover of Time magazine.                 Probably so, the editors concluded. Scientists were in fact divided                 on that, and vigorously debated whether global warming had raised                 the risk to New Orleans at all. This was another case where an event                 that was not really a clear sign of global warming nevertheless                 taught an accurate lesson, for it was certain that rising sea levels                 would eventually lift storm surges over the existing levees. But                 what really mattered was the imagery. The half-submerged buildings                 of science fiction, the \"environmental refugees\" that                 experts had been foreboding for decades, now filled Americans’                 television screens in real time.\n",

            "Media coverage and public concern revived a bit in 2012 following a spate of weather disasters, which many (including some scientists) thought could be partly blamed on global warming. In the wake of newsworthy droughts, wildfires and storms, non-governmental organizations concerned with climate changed the emphasis of their press releases: up to 2007 they had mainly warned of risks in the distant future, but now they were mainly emphasizing current risks.  A 2014 IPCC report also caught widespread attention by emphasizing that serious climate effects were already present, that harm to food supplies would provoke conflicts, and so forth. On the other hand, around 2013 the world media began to give attention to claims of a \"hiatus\" or pause in global warming — the average global atmospheric temperature was only slightly above what it had been in the unusual year 1998. (The temperature of the oceans, where most of the heat building up in the system was stored, continued to soar, but only scientists noticed that.)  In any case, according to a major study of American public opinion, the vagaries of weather and media attention were not the main factors in the post-2005 decline of public concern. The largest factor was elite opinion, as represented in particular by representatives in Congress —  their skepticism or enthusiasm did more than anything to shift the public. As a secondary factor, the economic troubles that afflicted the nation had displaced climate as a matter of concern.(153b)\n",

            "In all countries, even though majorities claimed to worry about global                 warming, many people still saw the problem as distant and abstract.                 Climate change felt remote not only in years but in geographical                 and emotional distance. To people in the developed world, global                 warming was not so much a problem for folks like themselves as for                 Pacific island natives and polar bears. One study concluded that                 most Americans still \"lacked vivid, concrete, and personally-relevant                 affective images of climate change, which helped explain why climate                 change remains a relatively low priority...issue.\"\n",

            "Some farsighted individuals in U.S. business, local and state government, federal agencies including the military, and other influential fields did recognize that they had a responsibility to offer such leadership. And the segment of the public that was acutely concerned became increasingly active. Old and new environmental groups formed organizational coalitions and focused on bringing public pressure to bear. One of their rallying points was a scientific calculation that the rise of global temperature could not be held below 2°C (the internationally accepted point at which the warming would become \"dangerous\") unless at least half the known reserves of fossil fuels were left in the ground. Popularized in 2012 by Bill McKibben, the discovery led to pressure on colleges and businesses to divest themselves of investments in corporations that relied on such \"stranded assets.\"Another push came from an encyclical the Catholic Church promulgated in 2015. It was a moral duty, declared the popular Pope Francis, to preserve the environment by reducing consumption, in particular through curbing greenhouse gas emissions.(157)\n",

            "Anyone seeking to understand climate change and anthropogenic greenhouse warming is well advised to read not only the current literature, but also the key scientific papers of earlier eras.  History is particularly relevant since, over timescales of decades and centuries, ideas about the climate have been changing faster than the physical climate system.  Thus, students of climate dynamics should also be well read in science dynamics—the change of scientific ideas and practices over time.\n",
            "\n",
            "Original, peer-reviewed publications of scientists, along with archival materials, constitute the basic building blocks of history.  Reading a scientific paper “in the author’s words” is a challenging undertaking.  It exposes the reader to terminology, technologies, standards, and practices of another era.  It might raise more questions than it answers—and this can be a starting point for historical research, or at least it can sensitize the reader to the complexities of the past and place current research in a long line of previous accomplishments.\n",
            "\n",
            "Theory, experiments, measurements, and models are all prominently featured here.  The ninetieth century is represented by four papers.  Theoretical articles by the French scientists Fourier and Poulliet, dating from the first half of the nineteenth century, and appearing in English translation, introduce a foreign mental world in which the greenhouse effect, the “temperature of space,” and residual heat from the Earth’s formation all play roles in determining terrestrial temperatures.  Yet even these theories, which pre-date the basic laws of radiative transfer, were based on careful laboratory experiments and observations of the natural world.  Tyndall’s pathbreaking 1861 paper reports the results of basic laboratory experiments on the absorption properties of what have come to be known as the “greenhouse gasses,” while Arrhenius’s 1896 model, the first of its kind, examines glacial and interglacial conditions as influenced by carbon dioxide concentrations.  Here we find the experiment of doubling CO2 in the model and the notion that warming can be magnified at high latitudes.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ekholm’s 1901 review of climate variations is notable for its encyclopedic content and for its examination of human influences on the climate system, including the then new idea of possible anthropogenic greenhouse warming.  After a hiatus of several decades, Callendar revived the carbon dioxide theory of climate change in 1938 by linking rising temperatures, rising CO2 emissions, and a new, more detailed understanding of the spectrum of infrared absorption and emission—the so-called “Callendar Effect.”  Gilbert Plass strongly supported this conclusion and, in the early 1950s, contributed the first computer models of the natural and human enhanced greenhouse effect.  Bolin and Ericksson’s 1958 paper helped clarify the carbonate chemistry of the oceans and their role uptake of carbon dioxide.  The prophetic article by Edward Lorenz, published in 1963, had a significant and widespread impact on all of science, and even on popular culture.  It serves as a reminder to all climate modelers to account for the chaotic properties of the phenomena they are modeling.\n",
            "\n",
            "The second half of the collection deals mainly with the varieties of climate modeling in the past forty years, since the climate sensitivity studies of Manabe and Wetherald using general circulation models and the energy budget models of Budyko and Sellers.  The articles by Hansen et al., Cess et al., and Santer et al. are three examples of such sensitivity studies that bring us up to the recent reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  But there is more to contemporary climate studies than modeling.  Keeling’s 1970 article reports on ongoing measurements of CO2 from Hawaii and Antarctica while sounding an environmental warning that is still relevant today.  Vonder Haar and Suomi used newly available satellite technology to make direct measurements of the Earth’s radiation budget, a task that has continued ever since. In 1974 chlorofluorocarbons were discovered to be having an adverse chemical effect on stratospheric ozone levels.  Within a year Ramanathan pointed to their adverse climatic effect based on their infrared absorption properties.  In an exercise sponsored in 1979 by the National Academy of Sciences and often repeated since, Charney et al. synthesized scientific opinion on the adverse effect of rising levels of carbon dioxide.  Kellogg’s history of human impact on climate serves to remind us that we have known, for quite a long time, the likely consequences of our unprecedented consumption of fossil fuels.\n",

            "The following articles constitute a pathway through the complexities of the past two hundred years of climate science.  Others might have been chosen, and some deserving papers have been omitted in the interest of space, but most will agree, these are all significant contributions to knowledge.  Each is accompanied by a short historical essay.  In addition to their great diversity of style and the long time span covered, these papers are remarkable for the growing consensus represented here, a convergence of scientific opinion that indicates the seriousness of climate change and our responsibility to take positive steps to reduce human impacts.\n",

            "The climate movement is a global social movement focused on pressuring governments and industry to take action (also called \"climate action\") addressing the causes and impacts of climate change. Environmental non-profit organizations have engaged in significant climate activism since the late 1980s and early 1990s, as they sought to influence the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).[1] Climate activism has become increasingly prominent over time, gaining significant momentum during the 2009 Copenhagen Summit and particularly following the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2016.[2]\n",
            "\n",
            "Environmental organizations take various actions such as Peoples Climate Marches. A major event was the global climate strike in September 2019 organized by Fridays For Future and Earth Strike.[3] The target was to influence the climate action summit organized by the UN on 23 September.[4] According to the organizers four million people participated in the strike on 20 September.[5] Youth activism and involvement has played an important part in the evolution of the movement after the growth of the Fridays For Future strikes started by Greta Thunberg in 2019.[2] In 2019, Extinction Rebellion organized large protests demanding to \"reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025, and create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress\", including blocking roads.[6]\n",
            "\n",
            "Activism related to climate change began in the late 1980s,[7] when major environmental organizations became involved in the discussions about climate, mainly in the UNFCCC framework. Whereas environmental organizations had previously primarily been engaged at the domestic level, they began to increasingly engage in international campaigning.[7] The largest transnational climate change coalition, Climate Action Network, was founded in 1992.[8] Its major members include Greenpeace, WWF, Oxfam and Friends of the Earth.[8] Climate Justice Now! and Climate Justice Action, two major coalitions, were founded in the lead-up to the 2009 Copenhagen Summit.[8]\n",
            "\n",
            "The 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen was the first UNFCCC summit in which the climate movement started showing its mobilization power at a large scale. According to Jennifer Hadden, the number of new NGOs registered with the UNFCCC surged in 2009 in the lead-up to the Copenhagen summit.[1] Between 40,000 and 100,000 people attended a march in Copenhagen on December 12 calling for a global agreement on climate.[9] Activism went beyond Copenhagen, with more than 5,400 rallies and demonstrations took place around the world simultaneously.[10]\n",

            "Climate activists are sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals, but the truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels.\n",
            "\n",
            "All three of these methods have been implemented in climate campaigns aimed at the general public. The information about the impacts of global climate change plays a role in forming climatic beliefs, attitudes, and behavior, while the effects of other approaches (e.g. provision of information about solutions to GCC, consensus framing, use of mechanistic information) is yet mostly unknown.[12] The third approach is to create space for discussions that move beyond questions of economic interests that often dominate political debates to emphasize ecological values and grass-roots democracy. This has been argued to be crucial to bringing about more significant structural change.[13] Some politicians, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger with the slogan \"terminate pollution\", say that activists should generate optimism by focusing on the health co-benefits of climate action.[14]\n",

            "Climate disobedience is a form of civil disobedience, deliberate action intended to critique government climate policy. In 2008, American climate activist Tim DeChristopher posed as a bidder at an auction of US Bureau of Land Management oil and gas leases of public land in Utah, won the auction, reneged on payment, and was imprisoned for 21 months. In September 2015, five climate activists known as the Delta 5 obstructed an oil train in Everett, Washington. At trial, the Delta 5 were allowed the necessity defense, that is, breaking a law in the service of preventing a greater harm. After testimony, the judge determined the grounds for the necessity defense were not met and instructed the jury to disregard testimony admitted under the necessity defense. The Delta 5 were fined for trespassing but were acquitted of more serious charges.[15][16][17][18]\n",

To date, many governments have acknowledged, sometimes in the form of tentative text-form \"declarations\", that humanity is essentially in a state of climate emergency.\n",

Banks and investors have been increasingly questioning the viability of the fossil fuel sector in the long-term. This is because this disinvestment movement is stigmatizing fossil fuels and is raising uncertainty around continued use of fossil fuels, thus reducing the financial desirability of fossil fuel assets. Because the extraction, exploration, and mining of fossil fuels are all capital-intensive activities, uncertainty around their financial risks can reduce investment. If there is a reduction in the supply of capital or a rise in the costs of capital, fossil fuel projects will end up being uneconomical. This will make the valuation of fossil fuel companies go down making them to go out of the market.[47]\n",

In these campaigns, campaigners demand so see that the public institutions server their ties that they have always had with this fossil fuel industry for the main purpose of tarnishing the reputation of the fossil fuel industry and to challenge the power that the industry has.[53] By doing these, these campaigners thus want to starve fossil fuel companies of the badly needed capital and to remove both the infrastructure and the influence that this industry has.[54]\n",

            "How do civil society organizations mobilize on climate change? Why do they choose certain strategies over others? What are the consequences of these choices? Networks in Contention examines how the interactions between different organizations within the international climate change movement shape strategic decisions and the kinds of outcomes organizations are able to achieve. First, it documents how and why cleavages emerged in this once-unified movement around the time of the 2009 Copenhagen Summit. Second, it shows how an organization's position in the movement's network has a large influence on the tactics it adopts. Finally, it demonstrates how the development of new strategies within this network has influenced the trajectory of global climate politics. The book establishes the ways in which networks are consequential for civil society groups, exploring how these actors can become more effective and suggesting lessons for the future coordination of activism.\n",
            "\n",
            "'In a theoretically innovative and timely new book on climate change activism, Jennifer Hadden adopts a relational approach to collective action to uncover the emergence, evolution, and diversification of the transnational climate movement. Networks in Contention raises the bar for research situated at the cusp of social movement and international relations scholarship; it combines the methodological rigors of network analysis with impressive empirical evidence and elegant prose to advance new insights about transnational advocacy networks and climate change policy.'\n",
            "\n",
            "'The 2009 climate summit in Copenhagen was remarkable not for its failure to outline a post-Kyoto climate change mitigation regime, which was expected, but for the public emergence of sharp divisions among civil society groups campaigning for action on climate change. Jennifer Hadden describes and explains the development of these competing networks and their impacts. This excellent book makes an outstanding contribution to elucidating the dynamics of a transnational social movement, as well as to our understanding of mobilized contention over climate change.'\n",
            "\n",
            "'This study documents changes in climate activist networks at a time of increased conflict and uncertainty in the international arena. In the mid-2000s, activists converged around a more critical and confrontational strategy that transgressed the previous boundaries of international climate politics. Jennifer Hadden’s detailed analysis of changing transnational networks informs the study of social movements and their roles in transforming inter-state politics. The fact that groups representing those least advantaged by the dominant order have disrupted business as usual in the global climate negotiations is a vitally important story. This book should be read not just for its contributions on the politics of transnational networks, but for its attention to the larger question of how people come together to confront urgent problems that cross national borders and institutional boundaries.'\n",
            "\n",
            "'Advocacy networks have long been understood as crucial to world politics, yet few studies use social network theory to understand how they mobilize and exercise influence. Jennifer Hadden breaks new ground, combining network analysis with qualitative methods to show how network structure influences both the tactical choices and political influence of transnational environmental networks.'\n",

            "\n",
            "In a 20-minute speech, May went through a list of bills she felt were positive from the last few months in Ottawa. Afterwards, guests in the audience were welcomed to ask questions.\n",
            "\n",
            "There were about 70 people in attendance — most of them were older, and many of them May knew by name. Despite the fact that the event was held at the university, there were no UVic students in attendance.\n",
            "\n",
            "Her speech started with a logistical update on the new seating arrangement in the House of Commons, as she now sits beside former Liberal MPs Jody Wilson Raybould and Jane Philpott instead of the People’s Party of Canada leader Maxine Bernier.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "May expressed her disappointment with some bills she felt were unfairly held up and killed by the Senate. For instance, she called the former Conservative leader Rona Ambrose ‘a dear friend’, and expressed her disappointment that Ambrose’s mandatory sexual assault training bill did not pass. The bill would’ve required federally appointed judges to take training on sexual assault.\n",

            "With an election around the corner, May will now focus on campaigning. This is one of many nonpartisan town halls she has hosted to update her constituents on parliamentary proceedings since the last election.\n",
            "\n",
            "May answered questions from the audience for the majority of the town hall. The questions touched on a variety of issues, including undocumented immigration, money laundering, and, of course, climate change. At one point in the event, May took to the whiteboard to explain her frustration with the Paris targets.\n",
            "\n",
            "At the Paris conference, world leaders agreed that the global average temperature could not rise beyond one and a half degrees celsius beyond pre-industrial levels, without seeing catastrophic effects. Right now, we are at one degree. In advance of the Paris conference, former Prime Minister Stephen Harper proposed to lower Greenhouse Gas emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, this emissions goal is being cited as the Paris Target by the current Trudeau government. This target, May said, is insufficient to actually meet the Paris goal. Those who signed the agreement in Paris agreed that going above that 1.5 degrees would be detrimental to the planet — and May argued the emissions target Trudeau and her other colleagues in parliament are aiming for does not go far enough.\n",
            "\n",
            "May joked that she wished the leader’s debate allowed her to write on a whiteboard, so she could educate voters about this distinction between the actual Paris Agreement and Trudeau’s goals. She stepped away from the board to answer the next question, leaving percentages and arrows sprawled across three whiteboards.\n",
            "\n",
            "One of the last questions asked the room to take a moment of silence for those in India dying due to extreme heat, to which no one had any objections. The room fell silent, until May walked back to the whiteboard and wrote, again in all caps, “GRETA THUNBERG.”\n",

            "On Wednesday, I was arrested for locking myself to an entrance to the JP Morgan Chase building in downtown Los Angeles with colleagues and supporters. Our action in LA is part of an international campaign organized by a loosely knit group of concerned scientists called Scientist Rebellion, involving more than 1,200 scientists in 26 countries and supported by local climate groups. Our day of action follows the IPCC Working Group 3 report released Monday, which details the harrowing gap between where society is heading and where we need to go. Our movement is growing fast.\n",
            "\n",
            "We chose JP Morgan Chase because out of all the investment banks in the world, JP Morgan Chase funds the most new fossil fuel projects. As the new IPCC report explains, emissions from current and planned fossil energy infrastructure are already more than twice the amount that would push the planet over 1.5°C of global heating, a level of heating that will bring much more intense heat, fire, storms, flooding, and drought than the present 1.2°C.\n",
            "\n",
            "Even limiting heating to below 2°C, a level of heating that in my opinion could threaten civilization as we know it, would require emissions to peak before 2025. As UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said in the press conference on Monday: “Investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure is moral and economic madness.” And yet, this is precisely what President Biden, most other world leaders, and major banks are doing. It’s no exaggeration to say that Chase and other banks are contributing to murder and neocide through their fossil fuel finance.\n",
            "\n",
            "Earth breakdown is much worse than most people realize. The science indicates that as fossil fuels continue to heat our planet, everything we love is at risk. For me, one of the most horrific aspects of all this is the juxtaposition of present-day and near-future climate disasters with the “business as usual” occurring all around me. It’s so surreal that I often find myself reviewing the science to make sure it’s really happening, a sort of scientific nightmare arm-pinch. Yes, it’s really happening.\n",
            "\n",
            "I hate being the Cassandra. I’d rather just be with my family and do science. But I feel morally compelled to sound the alarm. By the time I switched from astrophysics into Earth science in 2012, I’d realized that facts alone were not persuading world leaders to take action. So I explored other ways to create social change, all the while becoming increasingly concerned. I joined Citizens’ Climate Lobby. I reduced my own emissions by 90% and wrote a book about how this turned out to be satisfying, fun, and connecting. I gave up flying, started a website to help encourage others, and organized colleagues to pressure the American Geophysical Union to reduce academic flying. I helped organize FridaysForFuture in the US. I co-founded a popular climate app and started the first ad agency for the Earth. I spoke at climate rallies, city council meetings, and local libraries and churches. I wrote article after article, open letter after open letter. I gave hundreds of interviews, always with authenticity, solid facts, and an openness to showing vulnerability. I’ve encouraged and supported countless climate activists and young people behind the scenes. And this was all on my personal time and at no small risk to my scientific career.\n",
            "\n",
            "Nothing has worked. It’s now the eleventh hour and I feel terrified for my kids, and terrified for humanity. I feel deep grief over the loss of forests and corals and diminishing biodiversity. But I’ll keep fighting as hard as I can for this Earth, no matter how bad it gets, because it can always get worse. And it will continue to get worse until we end the fossil fuel industry and the exponential quest for ever more profit at the expense of everything else. There is no way to fool physics.\n",

It’s time we all join them. The feeling of solidarity is a wonderful balm.\n",

            "Social movements seek to influence views on environmental issues and put pressure on policy-makers in a range of related areas. But alongside their specific goals, they also often strive to create space for genuine deliberation about the need for societal transformation. This ‘dual orientation’ places them theoretically between social movement studies’ focus on strategic considerations and the ‘sincere’ (truthful) communication envisioned by democratic theorists to be a condition for ‘authentic’ deliberation, in which actors genuinely seek to understand each other’s views. Engaging with both fields of theory, a framework is developed for separating actions that are strategic, sincere and employ sincerity as strategy. Actors choose sincerity as a strategy when they practice truthful reasoning as a means to advance their interests in the public sphere. As illustrated by green movements, the concept captures how activists may handle three risks in public discourse: commercialization, politicization and idealization.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here, I examine the relationship between strategy and sincerity and its implications for political activism, developing a third position which I term sincerity as strategy. Sincerity as strategy refers to the purposeful employment of sincerity to advance interests in the public sphere. To do so, I draw on Habermas’ suggestion that movements may act with a ‘dual orientation’, combining strategy (goal advancement) and sincerity (the promotion of mutual understanding). By analytically separating these two orientations of action as two kinds of action, it becomes possible to distinguish between actions that are strategic; sincere; and employ sincerity as strategy. I argue that the last type of action often has stronger potential than actions that are only strategic, which are cynical or opportunist, or actions that are purely sincere, which are idealistic. In the long run, to advance political ideals, movements need to consider both dimensions, and act in ways that are strategically sound and sincere.\n",
            "\n",
            "To develop my argument, I first discuss the literatures on social movements and on deliberation, clarifying the distinction between strategic and sincere orientations. Then, I develop a theoretical framework for ‘sincerity as strategy’, before illustrating its usefulness by discussing the response of the transnational climate change movement to three risks in public deliberation: commercialization, politicization and idealization. In conclusion, I argue that the analytical framework of sincerity as strategy captures important challenges faced by the movement better than ‘one-dimensional’ views that see and judge action in the public sphere from either a strictly strategic or a strict sincerity perspective.\n",
            "\n",
            "Polletta shows that from the perspective of deliberation, participants are assumed to be oriented toward mutual understanding. Protesters, on the other hand, are assumed to want to accomplish a goal, seen to advance the common good, by persuading others. Protesters are, therefore, seen to be less open to changing their views through exchanges with others, unless such exchanges reveal that other paths would appear more advantageous. As strategic actors, they calculate the best action based on the actual and expected actions of others, which may affect the success of different options. Strategic actors do not, as participants in authentic deliberation might, change their views based on exchanges with others, through which they come to question their own values and the means to best fulfill them.\n",
            "\n",
            "Habermas’ theory creates a bridge between deliberative theory and social movement studies by highlighting the role of movements in public sphere deliberation. Their role, according to Habermas, is neither to engage purely strategically in public deliberation to advance their conception of the common good, nor to simply aim for mutual understanding through authentic collective reasoning. Instead, their role is to do both at once – to act, that is, with a ‘dual orientation’. Movements, according to Habermas, help maintain the communicative structures of the public sphere, while using them for their own purposes:\n",
            "\n",
            "Sincerity as strategy refers to the purposeful employment of truthfulness to gain long/term advantages in the public sphere. Actions that are both sincere and strategic constitute and sustain the public sphere, and thereby creates and maintains a platform for further engagement. Sincerity as strategy is the recognition that one’s strategic actions can either support or undermine the public sphere of sound argumentation, depending on whether they embody the norm of sincerity. It means to hold oneself and others accountable to the norm of sincerity, thereby insisting on its continued relevance. To do so strategically is to do so knowing that this norm is the basic condition for addressing important societal concerns that cannot be properly addressed in spheres characterized by instrumental reasoning. This is not to suggest that all actors at all times should choose sincerity as their strategy. Rather, some actors – such as movements that do wish to raise issues that are not easily addressed in contexts where discussions are dominated by instrumental reasoning (e.g. by political or commercial interests) – should find sincerity to be strategically advantageous, because it helps shift the terms of discussion in a favorable direction. In contrast, instrumental action risks further undermining the chance to do this, as might non-strategic sincere action.\n",
            "\n",
            "Sincerity as strategy adds analytical depth to understanding the challenges facing movements in public spheres. As illustrated in Figure 1, the idea of sincerity as strategy makes it possible to see that the actions of movements are not simply positioned along a scale from pure sincerity to purely strategic action, or from idealism to cynicism. Rather, they may see sincerity as a strategy and think strategically about how to best achieve authentic public deliberation. Sincerity as strategy is not a location between sincerity and strategy. It does not require a balancing act, because it is not a matter of finding equilibrium. Instead, it recognizes that there may be a strategic interest in shifting the debate toward sincerity – in which case, sincerity does not make an action less strategic – and, conversely, a sincere intention in strategically influencing the terms of debate in an advantageous direction. Figure 1 is meant to illustrate that thinking of sincerity and strategy as two poles of one single dimension limits the imagination of possible actions. It is possible to move from pure sincerity (idealism) to more strategically advantageous action without becoming any less sincere, if one moves from (a) to (c), instead of from (a) to (b). Conversely, a movement may shift from purely instrumental considerations to more sincerity without becoming any less strategic, if it moves from (b) to (c), rather than from (b) to (a).\n",
            "\n",
            "The risk of politicization is that environmental concerns are forced into discursive structures that are unfavorable to authentic deliberation about complex issues, like ethical questions of justice and responsibility. If established political discourse sets the terms of debate on environmental issues, it becomes difficult to discuss, for example, whether environmental concerns may be prioritized over economic interests. Instrumental reasoning alone cannot help maintaining a rational public sphere where complex concerns can be discussed. While the example of ALBA does not suggest that movements should reject cooperation with actors in the political sphere, it does suggest that the instrumental orientation of the political sphere constrains the space for authentic deliberation.\n",
            "\n",
            "On one hand, sincerity as strategy means taking the other side seriously and expecting the same in return. It suggests rejecting instrumental thinking and confronting others as equal participants in a conversation oriented toward mutual understanding. At the same time, however, it rejects a return to idealism as a solution and questions the false choice between (a) sincerity and (b) strategy. Sincerity as strategy avoids idealism, the third risk, by strategically plotting to shift the terms of debate away from commercialism and politics, toward authentic deliberation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Green movements may act strategically to expand spheres of authentic deliberation in response to three specific risks in public discourse: commercialization, politicization and idealization. I have focused on the case of the climate change movement, which has faced each of these risks. The framework of sincerity as strategy captures how the movement has found ways to be both strategic and sincere, which illustrates the argument that the choice between these rationalities is a false one. By maintaining and expanding the sphere of authentic public deliberation, green movements may improve their opportunities to make deeper impacts in deliberative systems.\n",
            "\n",
            "Researchers, as well as activists, could engage further in debates about the most suitable kinds of action to promote their various causes. For example, there might be contexts in which sincerity is the most strategically beneficial avenue, but also other contexts in which it is not, and where commercialization or politicization are actually more productive strategies. Making green consumption a matter of social distinction has contributed creatively to climate change awareness, and so has the accomplishments of green parties in several countries. Nevertheless, my argument here suggests that the latter strategies come with a significant trade-off, because such actions support terms of discourse that make it more difficult to address deeper issues of ethics and systemic failures. One might similarly ask if there are important trade-offs with making sincerity one’s strategy. Indeed, many researchers and activists would be right to ask whether we have time to care about the terms of discourse, as climate change appears to call for immediate action. To choose sincerity as strategy, and not strategies that appear more efficient, means accepting the risk that environmental change will cause serious harm in the short term, and that when we finally achieve authentic deliberation it might be too late to do much about the changing climate. On the other hand, the climate change movement is currently struggling to maintain its credibility as a force that is both independent of political and economic interests and realistic with regard to means and ends. Sincerity as strategy provides an analytical tool to study how movements handle these choices in light of the risks and possibilities that come with each option.\n",

            "In the quiet dark hours of early morning on September 2, 2014, a small group of climate activists made their way across the switching tracks of the BNSF Delta train yard in Everett, Washington. They erected a tripod over a section of track, locked themselves to it, and blocked the path of a mile-long, refinery-bound oil train for eight hours.\n",
            "\n",
            "Four of the group, Mike LaPointe, Patrick Mazza, Jackie Minchew, and Liz Spoerri, anchored the bottom of the tripod, while Abby Brockway, who has described herself as “a mother, a Presbyterian, and a lover of democracy,” perched at the top, 25 feet off the ground. Later that day, wearing a green hard hat and holding homemade climate-action banners, Brockway gave a phone statement to local television news with the group’s demand that Governor Jay Inslee take action on global warming by rejecting permits for all new fossil-fuel projects in Washington state.\n",
            "\n",
            "That was very big ask, but it got a crucial and underreported issue into the news. The state’s rail lines, rivers, and ports have made it a target for fossil-fuel companies seeking to export massive quantities of oil, coal, and gas from the North American interior to surging economies along the Pacific Rim.\n",
            "\n",
            "If all of the coal export terminals, oil-by-rail facilities, oil pipelines, and natural gas pipelines planned for the Pacific Northwest are completed and fully utilized, a 2014 Sightline Institute report found, “the region could export fossil fuels carrying five times as much climate-warming carbon as Keystone XL.” Keystone XL is, of course, the recently vetoed pipeline for tar-sands oil. And the extractors of tar-sands oil are now looking for alternative routes to get it to market.\n",
            "\n",
            "That’s obvious cause for consternation in climate circles. At present, at least 20 projects to build export terminals, refineries, or transportation infrastructure are proposed, planned, or on tentative hold for Washington and the rest of the Pacific Northwest.\n",
            "\n",
            "Sightline’s updated estimates of the climate impact of proposed crude-by-rail terminals have found that planned oil-by-rail facilities alone could  move 1 million barrels of tar-sands and Bakken-shale oil through Oregon and Washington per day. The extra oil production stimulated by the building of the terminals could contribute an additional 106 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, the equivalent of both doubling the greenhouse gas pollution of Washington state and doubling the number of cars on the road in Oregon and Washington.\n",
            "\n",
            "Those figures help explain why climate activists from the grassroots network Rising Tide put themselves on the frontline that September morning in 2014.

            "The gears of the criminal justice system grind slowly. So it was not until last week that the Delta 5, as they became known, had their day in court—in this case a full week and a jury trial that pushed the envelope on legal responses to civil disobedience as a means of climate change action.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Delta 5 sought to use the “necessity defense,” which holds that breaking the law to prevent a greater harm is justified. In this case, that blocking the track was necessary to prevent the danger of transporting explosive oil by train and the great harm of global warming caused by exporting and burning huge quantities of fossil fuels.\n",
            "\n",
            "The necessity defense, sought in the past by antiwar and nuclear-disarmament activists, has been allowed in only a handful of cases and successful in few. So it was something of a landmark when Judge Anthony G. Howard allowed the Delta 5 to present testimony, including from expert witnesses, to support the defense.\n",
            "\n",
            "The necessity defense gives defendants the opportunity to explain their motivations and address systemic issues directly in their testimony. The Delta 5 and their defense team used this opportunity to the full over the five days of the trial, held in Snohomish County’s South District Court.\n",
            "\n",
            "Patrick Mazza began the defendants’ testimony, describing his career as “promoting climate solutions.” He was asked to describe the climate change actions he had taken prior to blocking the oil train, thus establishing whether he had exhausted other avenues and activities before breaking the law. Mazza’s conversational testimony captivated the entire courtroom, including the judge and the prosecuting attorney.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Civil disobedience in America has moved the system forward—in women’s rights and in the civil rights movement,” he said. “We have to do creative, unusual things that get the people’s and the media’s attention.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Mazza described writing papers and working on campaigns to promote electric vehicles, sustainable aviation fuels, more efficient power grids, carbon reduction goals for the state, energy-efficient buildings, carbon soaking farming methods, sustainable animal feed—innovations and policies he said are possible and necessary to meet scientifically recommended carbon-reduction goals.\n",
            "\n",
            "He said this requires “a WWII-type large engagement of the public,” but the political system is not responding adequately because the world’s most powerful industry has fought climate change policy for decades. Working his testimony around seldom-sustained objections from the prosecution, Mazza said that as fossil-fuel companies have focused on defeating attempts to curb carbon emissions, citizens have been frozen out of the process because “corruption tied up the political system.”\n",
            "\n",
            "But, through actions like those taken by the Delta 5, he said, citizens can create enough pressure to make politicians change direction. “I’ve seen legislative defeat after legislative defeat. I feel in many ways our options are being exhausted here, because politicians are being bought off. The only alternative to political power is people power.”\n",
            "\n",
            "That view was reiterated in the testimony that followed from the other four defendants, each of whom expressed a sense of the global dangers of climate change and the local dangers of oil transport by rail and described the many types of activism they had tried before committing civil disobedience by blocking the train track.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then the court heard from the experts. Eric de Place presented the Sightline Institute’s research into fossil fuel export’s contribution to global warming. Scientist Richard Gammon spoke about the effects of global warming in the Pacific Northwest. Rail safety expert Fred Millar and BNSF safety whistleblower Mike Elliott gave testimony about the dangers of oil transport by rail. Physician Dr. Frank Eugene James spoke about the negative public-health impact of fossil fuel transport.\n",
            "\n",
            "The case for the defense seemed to be lined up when, four days into the trial, Judge Howard ruled that it had failed to establish the necessity defense and instructed the jurors to disregard what they had heard from the expert witnesses. He added that his instruction was based on legal precedent rather than his personal views: “Frankly, the court is convinced that the defendants are far from the problem and are part of the solution to the problem of climate change.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Apparently the jury thought so, too. The next day, they announced their verdict, finding the defendants not guilty of the more serious charge of blocking a train, and guilty only of trespass in the second degree. There was obvious relief when the judge issued sentences with no jail time: $550 fines and fees, a 90-day suspended sentence, and two years probation.\n",
            "\n",
            "The trial’s victory in gaining public support was evident even in the courthouse. After the verdict, three of the jurors gathered in the hall to talk to the Delta 5. “In a heartfelt conversation the jurors expressed their support for the defendants, told their lawyers they would have acquitted on all charges were necessity instructions given, agreed to work with the Climate Disobedience Center to improve further cases, and signed up to attend a lobbying day on oil trains with defendant Abby Brockway,” according to Rising Tide.\n",
            "\n",
            "During the week that the Delta 5 did their best to put political corruption and corporate greed on trial, it’s likely that some of the nearly mile-long trains running through Northwest neighborhoods and downtown Seattle were loaded with crude oil—not just any oil, but volatile Bakken shale oil. At the same time, public comment was open on the draft environmental impact statement for a proposed oil terminal on the Washington-state side of the Columbia River. If approved, the facility planned by Tesoro would be one of the largest crude-oil-by-rail terminals in the country.\n",
            "\n",
            "Given the realities on the ground, it’s likely that the Delta 5’s blockade will be followed by others as climate activists strive to draw a thin green line across the Pacific Northwest. Their motivation was expressed by Liz Spoerri in her testimony: “We only have a short window of opportunity to address this issue … I hate to see this beautiful place be a vehicle for devastation. I think if the citizens knew, we would make better choices.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The Delta 5 loss was actually a big win. “Frankly, the court is convinced that the defendants are far from the problem and are part of the solution to the problem of climate change.”\n",

It is impossible to understand these subjects in isolation because they are interconnected. The same is true of living organisms that greatly influence the global environment. The composition of the Earth’s atmosphere and the temperature of the surface is actively maintained and regulated by the biosphere, by life, by what the ancient Greeks used to call Gaia.\n",

I called this the Gaia theory, and was later joined by biologist Lynn Margulis, who also espoused this idea. Both of us were roundly criticised by scientists in academia. I was an outsider, an independent scientist, and the mainstream view then was the neo-Darwinist one that life adapts to the environment, not that the relationship also works in the other direction, as we argued. In the years since, we have seen just how much life – especially human life – can affect the environment. Two genocidal acts – suffocation by greenhouse gases and the clearance of the rainforests – have caused changes on a scale not seen in millions of years.\n",

            "For billions of years the Earth’s surface temperature has been determined mainly by the radiant heat coming from the sun. This energy increased over time because it is the nature of stars like the sun to increase their heat output as they grow older. But temperatures on Earth remained relatively stable thanks to Gaia: forests, oceans and other elements in the the Earth’s regulating system, which kept the surface temperature fairly constant and near optimal for life.\n",

            "The global warming that concerns all of us, and which will be discussed this week in Glasgow, includes a great deal of extra heating that comes as a consequence of extracting and burning fossil fuels since about the middle of the 19th century. That releases methane, carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere. They absorb radiant heat and stop it escaping from Earth. This is what causes global warming.\n",

            "The amount of global warming depends hugely on the properties of water. When cold ice forms, much of it is white snow. This reflects the sunlight back to space and is cooling. But when it is warm, the water vapour in the air is a powerful greenhouse gas that makes it warmer still.\n",
            "\n",
            "Much of the confusion over global heating comes about because of the huge quantities of heat needed to change the state of water. Few are aware that to melt a gram of ice takes 80 calories, enough heat to raise the temperature of 1ml of water to 80C. Try an ice cube in your boiling hot tea.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then imagine how much heat was needed to melt large areas of the polar ice cap during the recent summer and how much hotter the world would have been if the ice had not been there. No wonder there is confusion about whether there is global heating or not.\n",

It issued war bonds and borrowed massively. Between 1940 and 1945, total government spending rose roughly tenfold. Astonishingly the US government spent more money (in current dollar terms) between 1942 and 1945 than it had between 1789 and 1941. From 1940 to 1944, its military budget rose by a factor of 42, outstripping Germany’s, Japan’s and the United Kingdom’s put together.\n",

When the car industry was instructed to switch to military production, its massive equipment was immediately jack-hammered out of the floor and replaced, often in a matter of weeks, with new machines. General Motors began turning out tanks, aircraft engines, fighter planes, cannons and machine guns. Oldsmobile started making artillery shells; Pontiac produced anti-aircraft guns. By 1944, Ford was completing a long-range bomber plane almost every hour. During its three years of war, the US manufactured 87,000 naval vessels, including 27 aircraft carriers, 300,000 planes, 100,000 tanks and armoured cars and 44bn rounds of ammunition. Roosevelt described it as a “miracle of production”. But it wasn’t a miracle. It was the realisation of a well-laid plan.\n",

            "The US war effort mobilised tens of millions of people. Between 1940 and the end of the war, the number of American troops rose 26-fold, while the civilian labour force increased by 10 million. Many of the new workers were women.\n",
            "\n",
            "From 1942 until 1945, the manufacture of cars was banned. So were new household appliances and even the construction of new homes. Tyres and gasoline were strictly rationed; meat, butter, sugar, clothes and shoes were also limited. Rationing was considered fairer than taxing scarce goods: it ensured everyone received an equal share. A national speed limit of 35mph was imposed, to save fuel.\n",
            "\n",
            "Posters warned people “When you ride ALONE, you ride with Hitler! Join a car-sharing club TODAY”, and asked “Is this trip really necessary?”. They cautioned: “Waste helps the enemy: conserve material”. Americans were urged to sign the Consumer’s Victory Pledge: “I will buy carefully; I will take good care of the things I have; I will waste nothing.” Every imaginable material – chewing gum wrappers, rubber bands, used cooking fat – was recycled.\n",

            "So what stops the world from responding with the same decisive force to the greatest crisis humanity has ever faced? It’s not a lack of money or capacity or technology. If anything, digitisation would make such a transformation quicker and easier. It’s a problem that Roosevelt faced until Pearl Harbor: a lack of political will. Now, just as then, public hostility and indifference, encouraged by legacy industries (today, above all, fossil fuel, transport, infrastructure, meat and media), outweighs the demand for intervention.\n",
            "\n",
            "The difference between 1941 and 2021 is that now the mobilisation needs to come first. We need to build popular movements so big that governments have no choice but to respond to them, if they wish to remain in office. We need to make politicians understand that the survival of life on Earth is more important than their ideological commitment to limited government. Preventing Earth’s systems from flipping means flipping our political systems.\n",
            "\n",
            "So what is our Pearl Harbor moment? Well, how about now? After all, to extend the analogy, the Pacific seaboard of the US has recently come under unprecedented climatic attack. The heat domes, the droughts and fires there this year should have been enough to shock everyone out of their isolationism. But the gap between these events and people’s understanding of the forces that caused them is, arguably, the greatest public information failure in human history. We need bodies equivalent to Roosevelt’s Office of War Information, constantly reminding people of what is at stake.\n",
            "\n",
            "As the US mobilisation showed, when governments and societies decide to be competent, they can achieve things that at other times are considered impossible. Catastrophe is not a matter of fate. It’s a matter of choice.\n",
            "\n",
            "For years, environmental campaigners seeking to shake world leaders out of their torpor in the face of the escalating climate emergency have likened the requisite response to mobilising for war. In a seminal 2016 essay in The New Republic, writer and campaigner Bill McKibben argued global warming represented a \"world war aimed at us all\" and as such we must fight back. \"Turning out more solar panels and wind turbines may not sound like warfare, but it's exactly what won World War II: not just massive invasions and pitched tank battles and ferocious aerial bombardments, but the wholesale industrial retooling that was needed to build weapons and supply troops on a previously unprecedented scale,\" McKibben wrote. \"Defeating the Nazis required more than brave soldiers. It required building big factories, and building them really, really fast.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Of course, action on climate change is not exactly like a war, there is no enemy as such, the changes required are even more global in nature than a World War, and in the face of an actual invasion and all the horrors it entails the war-time metaphor risks sounding glib.\n",
            "\n",
            "But there are reasons why the analogy has proven so persistent. The idea of the net zero transition as a grand industrial revolution is arguably a more precise historical template, but industrial revolutions do not have to pursue set goals and even the fastest economic transformations play out over half century-long timeframes. The scale and pace of the emissions reductions required to deliver on the goals of the Paris Agreement - a near halving of global emissions in less than a decade, a net zero emission economy by 2050 - cannot be delivered without an industrial and policy overhaul more akin to the Allies' World War Two mobilisation. Hence it may be wrong to see the net zero transition as being like a war, but it should be like a war effort.\n",
            "\n",
            "And now, in the space of one terrifying and tragic week, these discussions have moved from the field of imperfect metaphor and message-testing focus groups to geopolitical reality and national policy frameworks.\n",
            "\n",
            "Vladimir Putin's brutal and unprovoked invasion on Ukraine has changed everything, and if it can seem facile to discuss economic and energy policies at a time when innocent families are facing unimaginable violence and the world is forced to process the reality of hair-trigger nuclear stand-off, it is still a critical part of the response to Russian aggression.\n",
            "\n",
            "Even under the absolute best-case scenarios - a swiftly negotiated settlement to the conflict and a change in leadership at the Kremlin - the always questionable idea that Russia was a reliable long-term supplier of energy has been consigned to history. Under the myriad horrific worst-case scenarios, which currently feel the more likely outcome, the moral and strategic need for Europe to end its imports of Russian gas, oil, and coal would become an absolute imperative. If Russia's superior numbers and willingness to engage in war crimes start to turn the course of the war, the already building clamour for the EU to accede to the Ukrainian government's plea for a full embargo on Russian oil and gas will become overwhelming. Equally, if Ukraine's brave resistance leads to a long and bloody war, there is a distinct possibility Putin could make the next move in the economic proxy war and restrict Russian exports in a bid to send energy prices surging higher still and fracture the unity of the Western coalition.\n",
            "\n",
            "Meanwhile, as yesterday's new report from IEA reiterates the reforms needed to curb fossil fuel imports are precisely the same as those needed to meet climate goals. The stakes may have got even higher and the timeline got more demanding still, but it is much the same strategy that has to be pursued: energy efficiency, clean energy capacity, flexible grids, electric transport and heating, relatively modest consumer behaviour change, and some domestic gas as a bridge fuel. The same armoury is needed for an economic war against Putin as is needed for McKibben's war against climate change.\n",
            "\n",
            "Consequently, doing everything possible to slash Russian fossil fuel imports to as close to zero as possible has become the ultimate no regrets policy choice. As Barbara Pompili, minister of the ecological transition of France, observed at today's publication of the IEA's new report on how to slash Europe's dependence on Russian gas, \"each additional wind turbine and solar panel in Europe is a step forward in the fight for the climate and for our energy independence\".\n",

            "However, what the IEA's traditionally structured 10 point plan and the various Twitter pledges from Energy Ministers across the continent have thus far struggled to capture is the sheer pace and scale of the changes that will be needed to properly end the continent's reliance on Russian oil, gas, and coal.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is easy to say that we need to accelerate clean energy development, drastically increase the number of energy efficiency upgrades, and convince the public that turning down the thermostat is as helpful as sending clothes to refugees. But to take a meaningful chunk out of Russian imports ahead of next winter would require the relaxation of planning and permitting rules for clean energy projects; huge increases in direct taxpayer funding for energy efficiency programmes; the rapid training of an army of builders, heat pump installers, and electric vehicle technicians; and political leaders brave and skillful enough to convince voters a long way from the actual front lines that they should make some small sacrifices in support of allies who are making the ultimate sacrifice.\n",
            "\n",
            "How to pay for such an ambitious programme? Well, plummeting clean tech costs means it will not cost as much as many fear and the returns on investment from energy efficiency upgrades in particular will be considerable. Moreover, a lot can be done without huge costs on exchequers through building codes, public information, and cleverly targeted tax breaks. Government could make a lot of progress by dusting off the many clean energy policies it has to date rejected - VAT cuts on clean tech, more funding for energy efficiency programmes, more generous capital allowances for businesses, bigger clean energy auctions - but all these policies would face skills and supply chain constraints, which would likely require government intervention to quickly overcome. Consequently, increased investment will be needed. But if this transformation is like a war effort and that direct funding is required, as it is, then green war bonds and windfall taxes would be as good a place to start as any.\n",
            "\n",
            "As an initial analysis from European economic think tank Bruegel indicated this week in a report that was notably more ambitious than IEA's vision for cutting Russian imports by a third to a half, Europe could get through next winter without Russian gas, but only if it acts now and is prepared for considerable, but crucially not catastrophic, disruption along the way. \"The main message is: if the EU is forced or willing to bear the cost, it should be possible to replace Russian gas already for next winter without economic activity being devastated, people freezing, or electricity supply being disrupted,\" the report states. \"But on the ground, dozens of regulations will have to be revised, usual procedures and operations revisited, a lot of money quickly spent and hard decisions taken. In many cases time will be too short for perfect answers.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "The big question is whether European governments, including the UK, are willing to spend this money and move sufficiently quickly to make a full end to Russian fossil fuel exports a reality. A combination of deficit hawkism, net zero scepticism, and brutal real politik (perhaps laced with Putin apologism) could yet undermine efforts to drastically transform the European energy landscape. But if the moral and strategic need to stop funding Putin's war machine and the long term need to build a net zero, climate resilience economy does not convince Europe's leaders to take bold action, then perhaps simple political self-interest should.\n",
            "\n",
            "For one of Putin's strategic goals remains the destabilisation of the West, and regardless of how the Russia-Ukraine War plays out he will see energy prices as the primary economic means for sowing division and rancour. As such, if governments fail to offer a credible path for ending our collective reliance on expensive imported energy and provide a clear plan for enhancing our economic, climate, and national security, then Putin's invasion, the resulting chaos on the energy markets and inevitable refugee crisis will have created the most fertile of electoral territory for the likes of Donald Trump and his populist fellow travellers.\n",
            "\n",
            "The West has indulged in 15 years of squandered opportunities to reshape an economic and geopolitical system that is demonstrably unfit for 21st century purposes. After the financial crash, Brexit, Trump, and the pandemic - and against a backdrop of an ever-worsening climate crisis, worsening geopolitical tensions, and stalled living standards and even life expectancies in parts of West - governments flirted with the idea of 'building back better'. But each time, despite some discrete successes, they mouthed platitudes and ultimately failed to deliver the step change in real world action that was so desperately needed.\n",

None of this is news to global-climate experts, who are meeting this week in Exeter, England, to discuss the scope and rate of climate change.

Watt-Cloutier and her group are planning to file a petition in the next few weeks with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, claiming that their human rights have been have been endangered due to excessive U.S. gas emissions.

            "\n",
            "NEWSWEEK: What effects of global warming have you seen? Sheila Watt-Cloutier: Over the last decade our hunters have been witnessing changes in certain areas. For example, some are saying that polar bears seem to be much thinner, and they have been finding bears closer and closer to food sources, places where they did not [previously] venture. The weather has become very unpredictable and that creates a lot of havoc not only with those of us who hunt on the sea ice, but with animals, as well. New species of fish and birds have been spotted up in the Arctic that are not indigenous.  People [have also] witnessed changes where ice forms later [and] the river ice breaks up so much earlier; it used to be in mid-June, and now it has been as early as mid-May. There is not as much snow, and the snow we get melts much earlier. In terms of summertime, in the course of my own life it was very rare that we ever used to wear shorts and T shirts because it never got warm enough. But today because there are such long heat waves where it is 30 Celsius [86 degrees Fahrenheit] for an entire month, the whole community goes to the beach and swims. It gets so hot that bugs do not even come around anymore.\n",
            "\n",
            "We come from a wise culture and are attuned to the cycles of life. But lately there has been confusion: our ancient wisdom says we have no control over weather and environment, but we now understand [that there is] a connection.  Just as the world came together to do the right thing on the contaminants issue at the Stockholm Convention [a global agreement reducing emissions of persistent organic pollutants ] we must do the same on the greenhouse-gas emissions. It’s not just an environmental issue, but also a health issue and a survival issue.\n",
            "\n",
            "Has the ICC always been political or is this a new direction you have been taking the group? We have been trying to find ways in which to put ourselves on the political map in a world where you have a powerful country like the United States that is staunchly standing for the status quo and does not want to change its economic policies and move away from dependence on oil gas and fossil fuels. We have a challenge on our hands. How do 155,000 Inuit of the world defend themselves in a world of billions and how do we make this a real people issue? We do not see it in terms of technology and politics. We see it as something that is changing our way of life everyday as we live it.\n",

            "So is this why you are pursuing this as a human-rights case--to get the world to listen? We have explored what international instruments are out there to protect us.  The U.S. and others feel they can continue business as usual when our entire way of life as we know it may end in my grandson’s lifetime.

It is the first comprehensive regional climate-change assessment ever taken. Over 250 scientists worked on the project, but also it is a marriage of Western and indigenous knowledge. We have been studied to death for decades up here in the Arctic, and we have not been part of the actual research itself.   So with the ACIA we wanted to ensure that there would be indigenous knowledge injected into the process as much as possible.\n",
            "\n",
            "What was the most surprising finding? It did make for stark reading.  The two conclusions [that affect us the most] are that the marine species that are dependent upon sea ice are likely to decline--with some facing extinction--and that for the Inuit, warming could disrupt or destroy hunting. One of the things that people cannot fully understand or appreciate is the actual power of the hunt and hunting culture. People think,  “Oh they are just killing animals”... When we go out on the land and teach [our children] to hunt, it’s not just about aiming the gun and skinning the seal.  It is also teaching courage and patience and how not to be impulsive and to use sound judgment. It is character skills that are transferable to the modern world.\n",

It means we are making our mark somewhere and getting under the skin of certain players. It does not surprise me, and I do not think we can go through with our work and not expect some criticism. The U.S. is a large and powerful country whose economic policies we do not feel are good for the planet.  I am not in this work to be in conflict with others, but I am trying to say this is what is happening … We are now changing the manner in which climate change is being debated and put it in the arena of human rights.

            "WASHINGTON, Oct. 7 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The Environmental Integrity Project (EIP) and the Sierra Club put the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on notice today that they intend to sue the agency for violating its duty to review and update its emissions standard for nitric acid plants at least once every eight years, as required under the Clean Air Act.  The two parties are represented by the Environmental and Natural Resources Law Clinic (ENRLC) at Vermont Law School.\n",
            "\n",
            "In addition to compelling EPA to update its nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission standard, EIP and Sierra Club want EPA to start controlling nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from nitric acid plants.  N2O is a powerful greenhouse gas.  It is 310 times more potent than carbon dioxide in terms of its global warming potential.  Nitric acid plants are, by far, the largest industrial source of N2O emissions in the United States, and these emissions would be surprisingly easy to control.\n",
            "\n",
            "Eric Schaeffer, director, Environmental Integrity Project, said: \"There are cost-effective ways to reduce nitrous oxide, using off-the-shelf technologies that have been available for years.  This is one of easiest ways for EPA to start making a dent in global warming emissions.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "If EPA does not commence a review of the new source performance standard (NSPS) for NOx during the required 60-day notice period, the parties will seek a court order compelling EPA to review its standards for controlling nitrogen oxide emissions from nitric acid plants.  The NOx standard has not been revised since it was adopted in 1971, and the last review took place twenty-four years ago, in 1984.  This means EPA has missed its deadline by a full 16 years.\n",
            "\n",
            "Teresa Clemmer, associate director, ENRLC, said: \"This is yet another example of regulatory foot-dragging that has become so commonplace at the EPA.  Much more effective and affordable technologies have been available for many years, and EPA should get started updating its regulation without any further delay.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Better technologies, capable of substantially reducing NOx emissions, have emerged during EPA's long period of delay.  In fact, EPA issued a report in 1991 describing some of these technologies, yet it has failed to apply these findings to the nitric acid industry.\n",
            "\n",
            "Using outdated technologies has real world consequences.  NOx -- a precursor to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ground-level ozone -- is an important public health concern.\n",
            "\n",
            "David Bookbinder, chief climate counsel, Sierra Club said: \"EPA is well aware that PM2.5 is causally linked with heart disease, asthma, and lung cancer.  Vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, children, and asthmatics, face the greatest risk.  EPA must do a better job of protecting the public from the serious health threats posed by NOx emissions.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "EIP and the Sierra Club believe EPA should move quickly to review and revise the NSPS for nitric acid plants.  Take Louisiana, for instance, which has several nitric acid plants.  Many citizens of Louisiana are suffering health problems relating to NOx emissions, and the state has been ravaged by climate change.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Environmental Integrity Project (http://www.environmentalintegrity.org) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization established in March of 2002 by former EPA enforcement attorneys to advocate for effective enforcement of environmental laws.  EIP has three goals:  1) to provide objective analyses of how the failure to enforce or implement environmental laws increases pollution and affects public health; 2) to hold federal and state agencies, as well as individual corporations, accountable for failing to enforce or comply with environmental laws; and 3) to help local communities obtain the protection of environmental laws.\n",

Residents of Middelburg and other communities in an industrialized swath of the Highveld, a plateau in central South Africa, are well acquainted with air pollution and its toll on health. The area — located east of Johannesburg and with a population of 4.7 million — is riddled with coal mines, coal-fired power plants, petrochemical facilities, metal smelters, chemical producers, and other industrial complexes. Mnguni, in his work as a community campaigner for the environmental group groundWork, has met many others dealing with the health consequences of the poor air quality, ranging from asthma to lung cancer.\n",
            "\n",
            "Researchers estimate that heightened air pollution levels in the Highveld cause hundreds of early deaths every year. A 2019 Greenpeace report ranked the region among the highest in the world for emissions of two dangerous pollutants, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. “It’s emblematic of one of the worst situations of air pollution in the world,” says David Boyd, a United Nations specialist on human rights and the environment. A substantial portion of the Highveld’s population lives in townships — underdeveloped areas on the outskirts of towns— among the mines or in the shadows of industrial facilities.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Highveld’s rampant pollution is largely a product of South Africa’s longstanding dependence on coal, which provides nearly 90 percent of the country’s electricity. Close ties between members of South Africa’s ruling party and the coal sector have perpetuated its dominance, enriching a few to the detriment of many. With about half of the country’s recoverable reserves, the Highveld is where the majority of the extraction and burning takes place. In the past century, billions of tons of coal have been dug out of the region’s shallow seams through open-cast and underground mines, and industrial facilities have bloomed near the vast, cheap energy source.\n",
            "\n",
            "A landscape of rolling grasslands and farm fields is increasingly dominated by smokestacks and an ever-expanding network of mines. The Highveld is now home to 12 coal-fired power plants and a massive refinery that produces liquid petroleum from coal. This single facility, owned by the South African company, Sasol, generates more greenhouse gas emissions than entire countries such as Norway and Portugal.\n",
            "\n",
            "Last year, environmental groups, including groundWork and the Vukani Environmental Movement, filed suit against the South African government for its failure to clean up the choking air pollution, arguing that it violates the residents’ constitutional right to “an environment that is not harmful to their health and well-being.” The case will be heard in court in May, lawyers involved in the litigation recently announced.\n",
            "\n",
            "It’s the first court case in South Africa to challenge air pollution on the basis of this constitutional right, but the litigation could have implications internationally as well. While few countries recognize clean air as a fundamental right, more than 150 acknowledge the right to a healthy environment, according to Boyd. He says the South Africa case could make tackling air pollution a human rights obligation, adding, “Right now, it’s not clear that the right to a healthy environment includes the right to breathe clean air.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Rico Euripidou, groundWork’s environmental health campaigner, says that “the South African government has this notion in their minds that coal is a gift,” and notes that the ongoing pollution in the Highveld has much to do with industrial activity that benefits the country’s elites. In the first half of the 20th century, the state-owned utility, Eskom, used coal to provide low-cost electricity to gold and diamond mining operations. During the apartheid era, which lasted from 1948 to 1994, the government built more coal-fired power plants and created Sasol to turn coal into fuel, further linking state and corporate interests.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Highveld’s poor air quality is a problem that the South African government has recognized for more than a decade. In 2007, the government declared a 12,000-square-mile portion of the Highveld an air pollution hotspot and priority area that required special air quality management action. Five years later, the government published an air quality management plan that outlined goals to bring air quality into compliance with national standards by 2020.\n",
            "\n",
            "Air pollution in the Highveld regularly exceeds South Africa’s national air quality standards. In 2018, particulate matter sized 2.5 microns or less exceeded national air quality standards on at least 103 days, according to data from government air quality monitoring stations. These fine particles get into the deepest parts of the lungs and can even infiltrate the bloodstream, causing a variety of ailments, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. Since South Africa’s air quality standards are weaker than the World Health Organization’s (WHO) guidelines, these extreme levels present a significant health hazard, says Peter Orris, professor of environmental and occupational health sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago. In 2019, the Centre for Environmental Rights, the law firm leading the ongoing legal battle, asked Orris to review the health effects of pollutants from the region’s coal-fired power plants and refineries.\n",
            "\n",
            "In a 2019 analysis, H. Andrew Gray, an air pollution expert consulting with the Centre for Environmental Rights, estimated that, at their peak, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide levels in the Highveld’s industrial region are 10 times higher than those the WHO considers safe for human health.\n",
            "\n",
            "In Middelburg, asthma is common, says Elise de Kock, a general practitioner at a local hospital. Compared to Johannesburg, asthma cases also tend to be more severe and often land people in the hospital, which she suspects may be due to the pollution. According to Gray’s report, fine particulate matter from the Highveld’s 12 coal-fired power plants and two refineries likely causes at least 300 early deaths per year.\n",
            "\n",
            "Thirteen years after the South African government vowed to clean up the Highveld’s air, there has been little progress. “We’re now getting to the end of 2020, and the majority of those goals haven’t been achieved,” says Timothy Lloyd, an attorney at the Centre for Environmental Rights who is handling the ongoing lawsuit. “We still see these really toxic levels of air pollution.”\n",
            "\n",
            "South Africa’s unemployment rate is roughly 30 percent, and groundWork’s Mnguni says people often move to the Highveld seeking work in coal-related industries, only to find themselves unable to leave. The hope of getting a job in the mines is the reason that Promise Mabilo, coordinator of the Vukani Environmental Movement, moved to the eMalahleni 23 years ago. Shortly after joining her in the Highveld, her son developed asthma and bronchitis. Growing up, his illness often kept him home from school, sometimes for months at a time, Mabilo says. The winter months, when meteorological phenomena called inversions trap pollution near the ground, are still difficult for him. On some days, the air is so thick “you can’t even see your neighbor,” she says.\n",
            "\n",
            "Through the litigation, groundWork and the Vukani Environmental Movement hope to see the federal government create regulations to enforce the management plan it created back in 2012. Right now, it’s just “a paper tiger sitting in someone’s office,” says groundWork’s Euripidou. From April 2016 to December 2017, Eskom exceeded its emissions limits for particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides more than 3,000 times, according to an analysis commissioned by the Centre for Environmental Rights.\n",
            "\n",
            "Air quality monitoring is also lacking. Many of the region’s monitoring stations are not functional, according to the government’s midterm review of the Highveld management plan. And although the government tightened sulfur dioxide emissions standards for combustion installations in April, the limits are still significantly weaker than China’s and India’s — two other developing nations with high levels of pollution.\n",
            "\n",
            "Meanwhile, the government allows some of the region’s biggest polluters to dodge complying with emissions limits. In 2013, Eskom submitted applications to postpone compliance at 11 of its coal-fired power plants located in the Highveld Priority Area, which the government largely granted. According to a public inquiry, Eskom also was involved in former President Jacob Zuma’s corrupt use of public enterprises. In 2015, while Zuma was in office, the utility awarded a lucrative contract to a mining company owned by his son and his wealthiest supporters, the Gupta family, despite its low-quality coal, according to media reports. In recent years, Eskom has submitted additional applications to postpone, suspend, or alter emissions limits at some of its plants, which are now being reviewed.\n",
            "\n",
            "Eskom estimates that bringing its entire fleet of power stations into compliance with emissions limits for all pollutants would cost about 300 billion rand ($19.4 billion), says Deidre Herbst, Eskom’s environmental manager. Instead, the company plans to pursue a lower-cost option by retrofitting plants to control particulate matter, which has a significant impact on health, and decommissioning 10 of its coal-fired power plants in or near the Highveld by 2040, she says.\n",
            "\n",
            "For now, however, coal remains the country’s favored energy source. According to a federal energy plan, it will make up the bulk of South Africa’s energy mix at least until 2030. Mnguni hopes that a favorable court ruling on the 2019 suit will force the government to hold polluters accountable. But so far, the government’s track record isn’t encouraging. “They seem to be defending industries more than defending basic human rights,” he says.\n",
            "\n",
            "Meanwhile, as residents wait for change, they are stuck relying on the same industries that make them sick. “We are trapped in this place,” says Mnguni.\n",
            "\n",
            "As South Africa clings to coal, a struggle for the right to breathe      Residents of the nation’s most coal-intensive region are suing to force the government to clean up choking air pollution.\n",

            "In a letter addressed to the head of PGE, Greenpeace Poland demanded that the coal utility giant phase out coal and pivot to renewables by 2030 at the latest. The environmental organization also urged PGE to drop plans to expand fossil fuel projects, including the Zloczew and Gubin-Brody lignite mines and the extension of the opencast mine in Turow. Should PGE fail to comply, Greenpeace warned that it would resort to legal action.\n",

            "\n",
            "A decade ago, noted environmentalist Bill McKibben had a radical-sounding idea. To save the planet, we needed to “revoke the social license of the fossil fuel industry.” His comprehensive vision of fossil fuel divestment would require financial institutions and civil society to stand shoulder-to-shoulder. This plan was audacious; in 2011 Exxon Mobil was the largest company in the world, and nearly every foundation and academic endowment invested in fossil fuels.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, divestment has gained remarkable traction in recent years, going from a fringe strategy to a $14.5 trillion movement with over a thousand major investors, pension plans, and endowments committed. Today, as institutional and retail investors pour money into environmentally conscious funds, it is time to consider the financial and social benefits of the movement.\n",
            "\n",
            "The divestment movement changed the conversation around fossil fuel finance. Investors and banks are increasingly questioning the long-term viability of the entire sector. Divestment seeks to stigmatize fossil fuels and raise uncertainty around their continued use, to reduce the financial desirability of fossil assets. Fossil fuel mining, exploration, and extraction all are capital intensive activities that demand constant access to capital. If capital costs rise or the supply of capital is reduced, projects can become uneconomical and fossil fuel companies can see their valuations fall. This process is well underway in financial markets for the most polluting and least efficient fossil fuel, coal. Even for oil and gas, a study across thirty-three nations indicates that increased divestment pledges are associated with decreased debt and equity capital flows to fossil fuel firms. Unsurprisingly, the effectiveness of divestment is amplified in countries with strong environmental policies and diminished in those that subsidize fossil fuels.\n",
            "\n",
            "Proponents of divestment may seek to starve fossil fuel producers of capital, but they are also making a savvy business decision. Over the past decade, the fossil fuel supermajors (e.g., Exxon, Chevron, Shell, BP) have tumbled from their perch as the planet’s largest companies. In 2020, Exxon was booted from the Dow. The once mighty energy sector is now the smallest sector in the S&P 500. Since its inception in 2012, the S&P 500’s Fossil Fuel Free Total Return Index has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 overall. As fossil fuel equity prices plummet, holding onto these companies has been value-destroying for many shareholders, leading market commentator Jim Cramer to declare “I’m done with fossil fuel stocks.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Fossil fuel debt has also proven a risky proposition. The raft of bankruptcies last year among fracking companies (including fracking pioneer Chesapeake Energy) revealed the volatility, capital-intensity, and unsustainability of their business models. Even larger companies are feeling the pain. Exxon, Shell, and Sonoco all saw their credit ratings cut this month.\n",
            "\n",
            "Fundamentally, fossil fuel companies are valued on their reserves. Climate science tells us that to maintain a safe climate, most of those reserves must remain in the ground. Unexploitable reserves become worthless, stranded assets. Write-down the value of these potentially stranded assets and fossil fuel companies are looking at a grim financial future. Financial institutions can choose divestment to avoid major losses and gain the opportunity to reinvest in more promising industries.\n",
            "\n",
            "Despite the accelerating growth of the divestment movement, capital has continued flowing into fossil fuels since the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. Some might argue that these continued inflows indicate that divestment has not worked. However, considering only immediate financial impacts of divestment misses the wider effects of the movement. An Oxford study made this point, stating, “the most far-reaching threat to fossil fuel companies” comes from increased social and political stigmatization of their activities and the resultant uncertainties around their long-term viability. Within finance, government, and civil society, the divestment movement has forced a fundamental reckoning with the future of the global energy system.\n",
            "\n",
            "Divestment has its share of critics. Many of them look at the continued financing of fossil fuels and see divestment as a blunt, or perhaps, naïve approach to addressing a complex problem. While the divestment movement alone may not solve the climate crisis, divestment must be considered within the broader ecosystem of climate action. Although it sits at one end of the climate finance spectrum, divestment has shifted the discourse around climate considerations in finance, which empowers other climate actors.\n",
            "\n",

It uses that argument as the basis for the following three distinct but reinforcing moral arguments in favor of divesting from fossil fuels: (1) investing in fossil fuels contributes to grave, substantial, and unnecessary harm and injustice; (2) divesting from fossil fuels helps fulfill our moral responsibility to promote climate action; and (3) investing in fossil fuels morally tarnishes those who do so by making them complicit in the injustices of the fossil fuel industry.

            "This article explores whether increasing fossil fuel divestment commitments are related to the reduction of capital flows into the oil and gas sector, based on an analysis of syndicated lending, equity and bond underwriting across 33 countries from 2000 to 2015. We find that increasing oil and gas divestment pledges in a country are associated with lower capital flows to domestic oil and gas companies. This effect is enhanced in more stringent environmental policy regimes and diminished in countries which heavily subsidise fossil fuels. However, the divestment movement may have an unintended effect, insofar as domestic banks situated in countries with high divestment commitments and stringent environmental policies provide more finance to oil and gas companies abroad. We explain these findings through the lens of institutional theory and show how both regulatory and socially normative elements of institutions shape this dynamic.\n",

            "Our study hence draws from and contributes to institutional theory. In exploring the impact of fossil fuel divestment commitments on new financing flows into the oil and gas sector, we frame the fossil fuel divestment movement as an emerging institution, which has operated primarily through normative pressure. We also contribute to theory by showing how the regulatory environment interacts with an emerging institution (i.e. the fossil fuel divestment movement), shaping its influence over valuable resources, which in turn helps explain the spatial variation in new oil and gas financing.\n",
            "\n",
            "We find that increasing oil and gas divestment pledges in a country, particularly where these are signalled by non-financial organisations and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), are associated with lower new capital flows to domestic oil and gas companies. This effect is enhanced in more stringent environmental policy regimes and diminished in countries which heavily subsidise fossil fuels. We also find that the divestment movement may be having an unintended effect, insofar as domestic banks situated in countries with high divestment commitments and stringent environmental policies provide more finance to oil and gas companies abroad.\n",

            "This article is structured as follows. In Section 2, we draw from the literature on institutional theory and economic geography to clarify our conceptual understanding of institutions and to explain why the spatiality of fossil fuel fundraising should manifest itself at the country level. We further employ an institutional theory lens to conceptualise and analyse how anti-fossil fuel norms impact fossil fuel fundraising, as well as how this impact is moderated by the formal regulatory environment. Section 3 presents our empirical model and data. Section 4 provides a synthesis of our results, which are then discussed in the context of our theoretical framing in Section 5. In Section 6, we discuss the implications and conclusions of our study.\n",
            "\n",
            "We find this broader conception of institutions helpful in considering the divestment movement, which has rapidly become a relatively stable pattern of social practice, with significant implications for the distribution of financial resources and the material consequences that flow from this, despite having only recently emerged and not comprising a single organisation or set of rules. Hence, we consider the fossil fuel divestment movement as an emerging institution. In the next section, we discuss how oil and gas financing—the target of the fossil fuel divestment movement—is likely to exhibit spatial variation at the country level.\n",
            "\n",
            "So far, no study has analysed whether the divestment movement has been successful in its goal to decrease the amount of new capital raised by fossil fuel companies. Hence, we test the following hypothesis:\n",

            "H.2: Pro-environmental (pro-fossil fuel) country policies accentuate (attenuate) the negative impact of the fossil fuel divestment campaign on all new oil and gas fundraising.\n",
            "\n",
            "While this literature shows that companies tend to relocate their carbon intensive operations as a result of more environmentally stringent policies, we know less about whether a similar approach is taken by banks, who in response to increased pressure to divest from fossil fuels in their home countries, may resort to investing in foreign oil and gas companies. Hence, we hypothesise that:\n",

            "In order to test the hypotheses outlined in the previous section, we provide the rationale for dependent and independent variables used in our statistical models, as further illustrated in Section 3.2.

            "We use the Dealogic database to construct a country variable of total fundraising by oil and gas companies (across equity, bond issuance and syndicated loans) across the world. Dealogic is a global database of investment bank transactions, which includes details on investment bank advisors and their clients for 673,102 fundraising deals across equity and debt issuance and syndicated loans between 2000 and 2015. We use the industry classification provided by Dealogic, which is based on the North American Industry Classification System, to identify oil and gas companies. The sample of public and private oil and gas companies come from sub-industries such as oil and gas extraction, distribution, oil and gas equipment manufacturing, oil and gas well drilling, oil and gas pipeline construction and operation and oil and gas refinery and marketing. Hence, we identify 19,057 fundraising events across the three financial instruments for the oil and gas sector (5,718 equity issuances; 3,754 bond issuances and 9,585 syndicated loans). We use the country of incorporation of the recipient company to aggregate the total fundraising by country, as well as the country of incorporation of the investment banks to determine whether the funding (in the case of loans) or underwriting (in the case of equity or bond issuance) was arranged by domestic or foreign banks. In addition, we quantify the total financing that a country’s domestic investment banks provide to foreign oil and gas companies.\n",
            "\n",
            "We are able to collect key independent variables and control variables over the 1999–2015 period (given the lag independent variable set-up) for 33 countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Slovak Republic, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the UK and the USA.\n",

            "The analysis is carried out at the country level, with data organised in a balanced panel for 33 countries over the period 2000–2015. We employ a log normal, panel-corrected standard error OLS regression model which includes country and year dummies and robust standard errors. For this, we implement the xtpcse estimator in STATA. Given the high correlation between GDP per capita and the composite EPS index, which suggest that richer countries may have more resources to deal with robust environmental management, we orthogonalise the latter variables with respect to GDP per capita, to avoid multicollinearity issues. This allows us to analyse the effect of GDP-adjusted EPS on oil and gas fundraising. In addition, gas production, gas reserves and oil reserves at the country level are highly correlated with oil production; hence, we orthogonalise these measures with respect to oil production.\n",

            "First, we analyse the relationship between the cumulative country-level fossil fuel divestment commitments and total oil and gas financing. We further unveil the type of organisations whose oil and gas divestment commitments have the greatest influence over new oil and gas fundraising. All models are specified as log–log regressions; hence, the results should be read as: a 1% increase at the mean of the independent variable is related to a β % increase at the mean of the dependent variable.\n",
            "\n",
            "Model 1.a shows the effect of our control variables, which remain robust throughout all other models. The revenues of the listed oil and gas sector are a significant determinant of total fundraising in the sector (β = 0.266, p < 0.05). In other words, a 1% increase in revenues of the oil and gas sector at the country level is related to an increase of c. 0.27% in fundraising the following year. The gas production, oil reserves and gas reserves variables are orthogonalised with respect to oil production, given that these variables are highly correlated. The models show that yearly orthogonalised gas production, which is uncorrelated with oil production, negatively impacts oil and gas fundraising (β = −0.62, p < 0.05). We also find that countries with higher shares of renewable energy supplies of total energy tend to display lower oil and gas financing levels (−0.947, p < 0.05). On the other hand, GDP per capita, environmental innovation (measured by environmental patents) and the country’s gas reserves do not have a significant effect on fundraising, nor do the direct effects of EPS and oil and gas subsidies.\n",
            "\n",
            "Model 1.b–f shows the relationship between total cumulative oil and gas divestment commitments (including across different types of divesting organisations) and oil and gas financing. We find that oil and gas divestment commitments are negatively and significantly related to new oil and gas financing (Model 1.b, β = −0.131, p < 0.05), driven mostly by the commitments of non-financial organisations, in particular NGOs (Model 1.e, β  = −0.247, p < 0.01).\n",
            "\n",
            "The possible mechanisms that might account for this reduction effect are manifold. While our article is not able to test empirically which mechanism applies, we suggest that the most likely scenarios are the following: (i) the social movement has some success in influencing investment banks who have yet to divest from or deny new capital to oil and gas companies; (ii) the movement affects the reputation or legitimacy of the oil and gas sector which in turn impacts on their ability to fundraise; or (iii) oil and gas companies postpone some capital fundraising activities when divestment attention is high, but may resume when attention is lower.\n",
            "\n",
            "Hence, our main models confirm H1 (that oil and gas divestment pledges are associated with lower oil and gas fundraising in a country) as well as H2 (which states that pro-environmental/pro-fossil fuel country policies accentuate/attenuate the negative impact of the fossil fuel divestment campaign on oil and gas fundraising), but they only partly confirm H3 (that investment banks in countries with a stronger fossil fuel divestment movement and more stringent environmental policies are more likely to invest in foreign oil and gas companies than domestic ones). The robustness tests we conduct further are also consistent with our main models. However, when we test for reverse causality, and also when we operationalise our dependent variable as total oil and gas fundraising out of the total amount of total amount of country lending and underwriting, the moderating effect of EPS on the effectiveness of the divestment movement no longer has statistical significance. Nevertheless, the interaction between the two variables maintains its sign (i.e. EPS still enhances the negative effect of divestment on oil and gas fundraising).\n",
            "\n",
            "This article shows that the fossil fuel divestment movement has been successful in reducing new capital flows into the oil and gas sector, but the movement’s normative effect is significantly moderated by the national regulatory environment. This is consistent with an observed tendency for finance to shift from more to less environmentally stringent countries, where perhaps the movement has less influence. Furthermore, while we find that the divestment movement has an effect on capital flows within individual countries, at an aggregate level across our 33 countries, oil and gas financing has nevertheless continued to increase at an average rate of c. 8% per year since the movement started in 2008.\n",
            "\n",
            "These findings have wide-ranging implications. For geographers interested in the impact of social movements, we show that varying norms and regulations across different countries are highly relevant in understanding the complexities of the low-carbon economy transition. Further research into the comparative impacts of the fossil fuel divestment movement at other geographical scales (e.g. local, regional and transnational) is a promising area of research that can build on the present study.\n",
            "\n",
            "For social activists seeking to impact fossil fuel investment, our paper shows that it is not enough to monitor the finance that investment banks provide to domestic fossil fuel companies: they also need to pay close attention to the foreign investments that the targeted investors make, and to the broader context of their home government’s environmental policies.\n",
            "\n",
            "For policymakers looking to become more sophisticated in their approach to accelerating the low-carbon transition, this study suggests that it is important to appreciate the normative as well as regulative influence that governments can have. Policymakers can enhance the effectiveness of their policies by considering the social norms which may impact on or be impacted by government policies.\n",

            "This article explores whether increasing fossil fuel divestment commitments are related to the reduction of capital flows into the oil and gas sector, based on an analysis of syndicated lending, equity and bond underwriting across 33 countries from 2000 to 2015. We find that increasing oil and gas divestment pledges in a country are associated with lower capital flows to domestic oil and gas companies. This effect is enhanced in more stringent environmental policy regimes and diminished in countries which heavily subsidise fossil fuels. However, the divestment movement may have an unintended effect, insofar as domestic banks situated in countries with high divestment commitments and stringent environmental policies provide more finance to oil and gas companies abroad. We explain these findings through the lens of institutional theory and show how both regulatory and socially normative elements of institutions shape this dynamic.\n",
            "\n",
            "Our study hence draws from and contributes to institutional theory. In exploring the impact of fossil fuel divestment commitments on new financing flows into the oil and gas sector, we frame the fossil fuel divestment movement as an emerging institution, which has operated primarily through normative pressure. We also contribute to theory by showing how the regulatory environment interacts with an emerging institution (i.e. the fossil fuel divestment movement), shaping its influence over valuable resources, which in turn helps explain the spatial variation in new oil and gas financing.\n",
            "\n",
            "We find that increasing oil and gas divestment pledges in a country, particularly where these are signalled by non-financial organisations and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), are associated with lower new capital flows to domestic oil and gas companies. This effect is enhanced in more stringent environmental policy regimes and diminished in countries which heavily subsidise fossil fuels. We also find that the divestment movement may be having an unintended effect, insofar as domestic banks situated in countries with high divestment commitments and stringent environmental policies provide more finance to oil and gas companies abroad.\n",
            "\n",
            "This article is structured as follows. In Section 2, we draw from the literature on institutional theory and economic geography to clarify our conceptual understanding of institutions and to explain why the spatiality of fossil fuel fundraising should manifest itself at the country level. We further employ an institutional theory lens to conceptualise and analyse how anti-fossil fuel norms impact fossil fuel fundraising, as well as how this impact is moderated by the formal regulatory environment. Section 3 presents our empirical model and data. Section 4 provides a synthesis of our results, which are then discussed in the context of our theoretical framing in Section 5. In Section 6, we discuss the implications and conclusions of our study.\n",
            "\n",
            "We find this broader conception of institutions helpful in considering the divestment movement, which has rapidly become a relatively stable pattern of social practice, with significant implications for the distribution of financial resources and the material consequences that flow from this, despite having only recently emerged and not comprising a single organisation or set of rules. Hence, we consider the fossil fuel divestment movement as an emerging institution. In the next section, we discuss how oil and gas financing—the target of the fossil fuel divestment movement—is likely to exhibit spatial variation at the country level.\n",
            "\n",
            "So far, no study has analysed whether the divestment movement has been successful in its goal to decrease the amount of new capital raised by fossil fuel companies. Hence, we test the following hypothesis:\n",
            "\n",
            "H.2: Pro-environmental (pro-fossil fuel) country policies accentuate (attenuate) the negative impact of the fossil fuel divestment campaign on all new oil and gas fundraising.\n",
            "\n",
            "While this literature shows that companies tend to relocate their carbon intensive operations as a result of more environmentally stringent policies, we know less about whether a similar approach is taken by banks, who in response to increased pressure to divest from fossil fuels in their home countries, may resort to investing in foreign oil and gas companies. Hence, we hypothesise that:\n",
            "\n",
            "H.3: Investment banks in countries with a stronger fossil fuel divestment movement and more stringent environmental policies are more likely to invest in foreign oil and gas companies than domestic ones.\n",
            "\n",
            "In order to test the hypotheses outlined in the previous section, we provide the rationale for dependent and independent variables used in our statistical models, as further illustrated in Section 3.2. Our article seeks to study the reduction in fossil fuel fundraising due to the divestment movement’s normative influence, and how this is impacted by the host country’s regulatory environment.\n",
            "\n",
            "We use the Dealogic database to construct a country variable of total fundraising by oil and gas companies (across equity, bond issuance and syndicated loans) across the world. Dealogic is a global database of investment bank transactions, which includes details on investment bank advisors and their clients for 673,102 fundraising deals across equity and debt issuance and syndicated loans between 2000 and 2015. We use the industry classification provided by Dealogic, which is based on the North American Industry Classification System, to identify oil and gas companies. The sample of public and private oil and gas companies come from sub-industries such as oil and gas extraction, distribution, oil and gas equipment manufacturing, oil and gas well drilling, oil and gas pipeline construction and operation and oil and gas refinery and marketing. Hence, we identify 19,057 fundraising events across the three financial instruments for the oil and gas sector (5,718 equity issuances; 3,754 bond issuances and 9,585 syndicated loans). We use the country of incorporation of the recipient company to aggregate the total fundraising by country, as well as the country of incorporation of the investment banks to determine whether the funding (in the case of loans) or underwriting (in the case of equity or bond issuance) was arranged by domestic or foreign banks. In addition, we quantify the total financing that a country’s domestic investment banks provide to foreign oil and gas companies.\n",
            "\n",
            "We are able to collect key independent variables and control variables over the 1999–2015 period (given the lag independent variable set-up) for 33 countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Slovak Republic, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the UK and the USA.\n",
            "\n",
            "The analysis is carried out at the country level, with data organised in a balanced panel for 33 countries over the period 2000–2015. We employ a log normal, panel-corrected standard error OLS regression model which includes country and year dummies and robust standard errors. For this, we implement the xtpcse estimator in STATA. Given the high correlation between GDP per capita and the composite EPS index, which suggest that richer countries may have more resources to deal with robust environmental management, we orthogonalise the latter variables with respect to GDP per capita, to avoid multicollinearity issues. This allows us to analyse the effect of GDP-adjusted EPS on oil and gas fundraising. In addition, gas production, gas reserves and oil reserves at the country level are highly correlated with oil production; hence, we orthogonalise these measures with respect to oil production.\n",

            "First, we analyse the relationship between the cumulative country-level fossil fuel divestment commitments and total oil and gas financing. We further unveil the type of organisations whose oil and gas divestment commitments have the greatest influence over new oil and gas fundraising. All models are specified as log–log regressions; hence, the results should be read as: a 1% increase at the mean of the independent variable is related to a β % increase at the mean of the dependent variable.\n",
            "\n",
            "Model 1.a shows the effect of our control variables, which remain robust throughout all other models. The revenues of the listed oil and gas sector are a significant determinant of total fundraising in the sector (β = 0.266, p < 0.05). In other words, a 1% increase in revenues of the oil and gas sector at the country level is related to an increase of c. 0.27% in fundraising the following year. The gas production, oil reserves and gas reserves variables are orthogonalised with respect to oil production, given that these variables are highly correlated. The models show that yearly orthogonalised gas production, which is uncorrelated with oil production, negatively impacts oil and gas fundraising (β = −0.62, p < 0.05). We also find that countries with higher shares of renewable energy supplies of total energy tend to display lower oil and gas financing levels (−0.947, p < 0.05). On the other hand, GDP per capita, environmental innovation (measured by environmental patents) and the country’s gas reserves do not have a significant effect on fundraising, nor do the direct effects of EPS and oil and gas subsidies.\n",
            "\n",
            "Model 1.b–f shows the relationship between total cumulative oil and gas divestment commitments (including across different types of divesting organisations) and oil and gas financing. We find that oil and gas divestment commitments are negatively and significantly related to new oil and gas financing (Model 1.b, β = −0.131, p < 0.05), driven mostly by the commitments of non-financial organisations, in particular NGOs (Model 1.e, β  = −0.247, p < 0.01).\n",
            "\n",
            "The possible mechanisms that might account for this reduction effect are manifold. While our article is not able to test empirically which mechanism applies, we suggest that the most likely scenarios are the following: (i) the social movement has some success in influencing investment banks who have yet to divest from or deny new capital to oil and gas companies; (ii) the movement affects the reputation or legitimacy of the oil and gas sector which in turn impacts on their ability to fundraise; or (iii) oil and gas companies postpone some capital fundraising activities when divestment attention is high, but may resume when attention is lower.\n",
            "\n",
            "Hence, our main models confirm H1 (that oil and gas divestment pledges are associated with lower oil and gas fundraising in a country) as well as H2 (which states that pro-environmental/pro-fossil fuel country policies accentuate/attenuate the negative impact of the fossil fuel divestment campaign on oil and gas fundraising), but they only partly confirm H3 (that investment banks in countries with a stronger fossil fuel divestment movement and more stringent environmental policies are more likely to invest in foreign oil and gas companies than domestic ones). The robustness tests we conduct further are also consistent with our main models. However, when we test for reverse causality, and also when we operationalise our dependent variable as total oil and gas fundraising out of the total amount of total amount of country lending and underwriting, the moderating effect of EPS on the effectiveness of the divestment movement no longer has statistical significance. Nevertheless, the interaction between the two variables maintains its sign (i.e. EPS still enhances the negative effect of divestment on oil and gas fundraising).\n",
            "\n",
            "This article shows that the fossil fuel divestment movement has been successful in reducing new capital flows into the oil and gas sector, but the movement’s normative effect is significantly moderated by the national regulatory environment. This is consistent with an observed tendency for finance to shift from more to less environmentally stringent countries, where perhaps the movement has less influence. Furthermore, while we find that the divestment movement has an effect on capital flows within individual countries, at an aggregate level across our 33 countries, oil and gas financing has nevertheless continued to increase at an average rate of c. 8% per year since the movement started in 2008.\n",
            "\n",
            "These findings have wide-ranging implications. For geographers interested in the impact of social movements, we show that varying norms and regulations across different countries are highly relevant in understanding the complexities of the low-carbon economy transition. Further research into the comparative impacts of the fossil fuel divestment movement at other geographical scales (e.g. local, regional and transnational) is a promising area of research that can build on the present study.\n",
            "\n",
            "For social activists seeking to impact fossil fuel investment, our paper shows that it is not enough to monitor the finance that investment banks provide to domestic fossil fuel companies: they also need to pay close attention to the foreign investments that the targeted investors make, and to the broader context of their home government’s environmental policies.\n",
            "\n",
            "For policymakers looking to become more sophisticated in their approach to accelerating the low-carbon transition, this study suggests that it is important to appreciate the normative as well as regulative influence that governments can have. Policymakers can enhance the effectiveness of their policies by considering the social norms which may impact on or be impacted by government policies.\n",

            "In the last decade, the fossil fuel divestment (FFD) movement has emerged as a key component of an international grassroots mobilization for climate justice. Using a text analysis of Facebook pages for 144 campaigns at higher education institutions (HEIs), this article presents an overview and analysis of the characteristics of the higher education (HE) FFD movement in the US. The results indicate that campaigns occur at a wide array of HEIs, concentrated on the east and west coasts. Primarily student led, campaigns set broad goals for divestment, while reinvestment is often a less clearly defined objective. Campaigns incorporate a mixture of environmental, social, and economic arguments into their messaging. Justice is a common theme, used often in a broad context rather than towards specific populations or communities impacted by climate change or other social issues. These insights contribute to the understanding of the HE FFD movement as ten years of campus organizing approaches. In particular, this study illustrates how the movement is pushing sustainability and climate action in HE and in broader society towards a greater focus on systemic change and social justice through campaigns’ hardline stance against fossil fuels and climate justice orientation.\n",

            "Replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy will be a critical strategy for keeping global warming below internationally recognized targets of 1.5 degrees Celsius and two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels [1,2,3]. Governments have recognized the need for urgent efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions yet have failed to implement strategies that explicitly challenge continued fossil fuel extraction and production [4]. Instead, focus has often been on market-based solutions like carbon trading and the promise of unproven technological fixes like carbon capture and storage, approaches which uphold current economic and political structures [5,6,7]. International climate accords, including the Paris Agreement, while establishing ambitious goals for transnational efforts to curb emissions, have ignored the issue of directly limiting fossil fuel extraction and production in favor of allowing countries to reduce emissions in ways that are less disruptive to the economic status quo like purchasing carbon offsets from emissions-reducing projects in developing countries [8,9,10].\n",
            "\n",
            "Faced with global crises like climate change, higher education institutions (HEIs) have the potential to act as agents of change to influence society towards greater sustainability [11]. Many HEIs have sought to take up a leadership role in the climate crisis, for example through integrating climate change education into curricula, climate change research, efforts to reduce campus greenhouse gas emissions, and incorporating climate change into strategic planning through commitments like the American College and University Presidents’ Climate Commitment (ACUPCC) [12,13,14,15]. However, sustainability discourse and action in higher education (HE) has often embodied a reformist, green economy approach that fails to challenge the root causes of crises like climate change [4,16,17].\n",
            "\n",
            "At the institution level, strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are internally-focused and incremental. For example, signatories of the ACUPCC have committed to becoming carbon neutral, a goal that many HEIs do not anticipate achieving until near-midcentury and is understood to likely require the purchase of carbon offsets which have questionable benefits for the climate due to challenges of ensuring that funds go towards projects that result in legitimate emissions reductions [18]. Students at HEIs are often engaged in sustainability initiatives narrowly focused on individual behavior change, such as addressing personal carbon footprints [17,19]. Meanwhile, education for sustainable development has broadly presented an uncritical, often idealistic view of sustainable development that neglects to question hegemonic structures underpinning many sustainability problems, like neoliberalism, globalization, and the economic growth imperative [20,21].\n",
            "\n",
            "This approach to sustainability in HE not only misframes the climate crisis as a problem that can be solved without radical economic and political change, but also often presents climate change independent of intersectional issues of environmental justice [4,16]. At the heart of these issues may be HE’s increasing alignment with a neoliberal agenda which has led HEIs to have an increased focus on institutional finances and competition with other HEIs [22,23], presenting a challenge to the ability of sustainability in HE to incite transition away from current unsustainable paradigms [4,24].\n",
            "\n",
            "Within the last ten years, the HE fossil fuel divestment (FFD) movement has emerged as a challenge to mainstream climate action and sustainability in HE and broader society by asking HEIs to explicitly cut ties with the fossil fuel industry through divestment of financial holdings in fossil fuel companies. The movement was initiated in 2011 when students at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania started a campaign to persuade their school to divest from coal companies in solidarity with Appalachian communities impacted by mountaintop removal mining [25,26]. Several other coal divestment campaigns were launched at US HEIs in 2011 and more campaigns soon followed with the call expanding to divestment from all fossil fuels [27].\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2012, Bill McKibben published the popular article “Global Warming’s Terrifying New Math” and embarked on the Do the Math Tour with his climate advocacy organization 350.org, promoting institutional FFD [17,28]. McKibben and 350.org, along with other organizations, subsequently worked to support the development of hundreds of FFD campaigns at HEIs in the US and internationally [17,29,30]. Though campaigns at some HEIs were met with stern rejection by administrators, FFD commitments from HEIs soon began rolling in [17]. FFD also soon expanded beyond HE to become a global movement of institutions, including faith-based organizations, philanthropic foundations, cities, and pension funds, committing to not invest in fossil fuels [26].\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2017, the major organizations promoting HE FFD in the US, including 350.org, scaled back on their support to HE campaigns and the movement on US campuses began to lose steam. To fill the gap, non-profit Better Future Project launched the program Divest Ed in 2018, which aimed to provide coaching and community to student FFD campaigns across the country [31]. Supported by Divest Ed, the US HE FFD movement saw a resurgent wave of escalation and successes in 2019 and early 2020, including notable commitments from the University of California System and Georgetown University, and a national day of action in February 2020 [32]. There are currently over 50 US HEIs that have committed to at least partial divestment from fossil fuels, ranging from small liberal arts colleges to large public university systems [33,34]. Signs point to the movement continuing with its momentum despite challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many campaigns turning to online tactics to continue organizing and putting pressure on administrators [35].\n",
            "\n",
            "FFD diverges from conventional reformist approaches to climate action and sustainability by explicitly seeking to put an end to continued fossil fuel extraction and production. By using divestment to take a moral stand against fossil fuel companies, the main aim of the movement is to create a social stigma against the fossil fuel industry, thereby generating political and economic pressure for a societal transition away from fossil fuels [4,16,17]. This strategy has precedent in previous divestment movements, including those against companies doing business in apartheid South Africa and the tobacco industry [36]. FFD therefore politicizes sustainability to achieve systemic change through collective action, a rebuke of mainstream greening approaches to sustainability which focus on incremental and individualized change [16,17].\n",
            "\n",
            "Divestment also entails the complementary step of reinvestment, in which divested money is reallocated towards more desirable investments. Calls for sustainable reinvestment are often made by HE FFD activists. This may take the form of demands for reinvestment into “climate solutions,” such as clean and renewable energy. Some campaigns and organizations have emphasized the need for reinvestment in communities, such as funding community-owned renewable energy projects [25,37]. Divest Ed encourages campaigns to work towards reinvestment in local economies led by marginalized communities, through investment in community development financial institutions or other means, to ensure an equitable reallocation of resources [38]. However, HEIs may simply reinvest into alternative investments based on the financial needs of their portfolio, such as non-fossil fuel companies and funds that perform similarly to fossil fuel investments [4].\n",
            "\n",
            "Unlike mainstream sustainability approaches that focus on environmental impacts of resource use, FFD is rooted in concerns for human wellbeing and social justice. The movement can be thought of as an extension of the environmental justice movement that began in the US in the 1980s with concerns over the disproportionate exposure of communities of color and low-income communities to toxic waste [16,39]. Environmental justice combines notions of environmental sustainability with social justice considerations, calling for equitable distribution of environmental risks and benefits and fair and inclusive decision-making on environmental issues. The concept of climate justice emerged naturally out of this framework [40], highlighting the disproportionate risks climate change poses to poor people, people of color, and Indigenous Peoples and the need for a “just transition” to a post-carbon economy that ensures fairness and equity in outcomes and procedural processes [41,42]. Climate justice activists have often been critical of market-based and consumerist approaches to climate mitigation, seeing them as catering to wealthy elites at the expense of vulnerable communities, and have insisted on keeping fossil fuels in the ground as a primary response [40,43]. A recent form of climate justice activism termed “Blockadia” has seen increasing resistance to fossil fuel and other extractive projects using direct action tactics and is often led by frontline communities who are at risk from these projects [44].\n",
            "\n",
            "FFD extends climate justice concerns and demands and applies them to institutional finance in a Blockadia-style attempt to cut off the social and financial support for fossil fuels. Climate justice has been central to the narrative of the HE FFD movement, with campaigns and organizations often highlighting the disproportionate impacts of climate change and fossil fuel extraction on historically marginalized populations and seeking to show solidarity with frontline communities that bear the brunt of their impacts [4,16,17,29].\n",
            "\n",
            "Beyond its impact on the fossil fuel industry, FFD has had the broader effect of reshaping discourse on climate change and sustainable finance. As the movement emerged, it introduced the radical idea to mainstream climate change discourse that fossil fuel companies must be immediately stopped to ensure a just and livable future for the planet. Empirical research has suggested this shifted the center of public climate change discourse in the early years of the movement resulting in liberal policy ideas that were previously seen as far reaching, such as a carbon tax and carbon budget, receiving increased attention and legitimacy. Meanwhile, the radical ideas presented by the FFD movement infiltrated conventional thinking in the finance world through increased attention to concepts describing risks of high carbon investments, like stranded assets and the carbon bubble [48]. The elevated concern around investments in fossil fuels has led to changes such as the increase in funds available to investors that do not have fossil fuel holdings and the questioning of traditional notions of fiduciary duty that have focused on maximizing short-term returns [30].\n",
            "\n",
            "Despite the importance of HEIs in the initiation and continued advancement of the FFD movement and the unique arena the HE context provides for shifting discourse on climate change and sustainability, scholarly work on FFD in HE has been limited [4,19,29]. Research has explored the movement through focus on campaigns at a limited number of HEIs [4,16,17], or has focused on narrow elements of the movement such as rationales used by divesting HEIs and the role of faculty in campaigns [49,50]. With the exception of Maina et al., (2020), who recently completed a study of all HE FFD campaigns in Canada [29], there has been little research that has explored the extent of the movement or its characteristics using data from a large portion of HEIs involved in the movement. This paper seeks to fill this gap with a focus on the US, examining the locations and types of institutions where campaigns occur, the stakeholders involved in campaigns and the goals they adopt, and the themes campaigns use in their messaging.\n",
            "\n",
            "Presented as ten years of organizing for FFD at HEIs approaches, this study provides an overview and analysis of the US HE FFD movement. The results contribute to a better understanding of the movement’s characteristics, demands, and how it fits within the broader context of sustainability and climate change discourse and action in HE and beyond. Particularly, this study illustrates how the HE FFD movement is pushing sustainability towards a greater focus on systemic change and social justice through campaigns’ hardline stance against fossil fuels and climate justice orientation. Finally, this study offers an opportunity for critical reflection on the HE FFD movement itself and suggestions are discussed for how the movement may continue to be developed.\n",
            "\n",
            "This study seeks to assess several factors that have been underexplored in the literature on the HE FFD movement in the US. First, the spatial distribution of campaigns and the type of HEIs where these campaigns occur is assessed. Second, the types of stakeholders involved in campaigns and common goals of campaigns are identified. This includes identification of campaigns’ goals for reinvestment, which has scarcely been explored in academic research. Third, common themes used in campaigns’ messaging are identified. This includes an examination of how campaigns address the notion of justice. Though climate justice has been heralded as a key tenet of the HE FFD movement [4,16,17], examination of how campaigns frame arguments around the notion of justice has been limited. This provides an important opportunity to assess the intersectionality of the movement, particularly as movements addressing race and diversity, such as Black Lives Matter and immigrants’ rights movements, have also found support from student activists at US HEIs in recent years [51].\n",
            "\n",
            "To address the research objectives, 144 FFD campaigns at US HEIs were analyzed, using a text analysis of Facebook pages associated with these campaigns. Social media has played an increasingly important role in social movements in recent years, facilitating instant communication and information-sharing among activists and between activists and other societal stakeholders [52,53,54]. This includes student activism, which has embraced social media as a new tool for campaigning and protesting [55,56]. Other research indicates that over 80% of FFD campaigns at HEIs in North America have a Facebook page and a host of other social media platforms are commonly used by campaigns [29]. This study exploits the ubiquitous use of social media in contemporary student movements to collect and analyze data on the characteristics of FFD campaigns at US HEIs from campaign Facebook pages.\n",
            "\n",
            "The sample was identified from records on active and inactive campaigns throughout the US provided by Divest Ed. The first phase of this study took place between May and August 2019, and sought to identify Facebook pages associated with campaigns. If a Facebook page was not listed within the records for a campaign, then an online search was conducted with the keywords “divest,” “fossil free,” and “fossil fuel divestment” along with the name of the HEI where the campaign was located. For any campaign where multiple Facebook pages were discovered, the most relevant page was selected based on criteria favoring pages with the most recent posts and pages with the most information on the campaign associated with them in their “About” section. A campaign at the authors’ home institution was excluded to maintain objectivity. This process generated a total sample of 144 FFD campaigns, each at a separate HEI. Table S1 provides a list of all HEIs with campaigns used in this study and URLs of the Facebook pages used for each campaign.\n",
            "\n",
            "The records from Divest Ed provided general information on the HEIs, including location and public or private designation of each institution. The spatial distribution of campaigns was assessed by totaling the number within each of the U.S. Census Bureau’s nine divisions [57], a system of regionality widely used for research [58,59].\n",
            "\n",
            "The analysis of the Facebook pages first involved extracting all the text from the “About” section for each page, which occurred between 17 January and 27 January 2020. The text for each page was then coded to identify types of stakeholders involved in campaigns, goals stated by campaigns, and themes campaigns used in their discussion of why they were organizing. Themes were organized under the three major categories of environmental, social, and economic, based on the three “pillars of sustainability” that are commonly used in the sustainability field [60,61,62].\n",
            "\n",
            "The way that campaigns addressed justice was considered within the social category. A reference to justice was considered any direct mentions of the concept through the words “justice” or “just,” references to disproportionate harms or deprivations being imparted on particular groups of people, or references to efforts to right such disproportionate harms or deprivations. Though justice was not only considered within the environmental context, this conception of justice is tied closely to the notion of equity at the root of the environmental justice movement, that injustice occurs from an unfair distribution of environmental costs and benefits across different groups of people [40].\n",
            "\n",
            "The 144 FFD campaigns in this study were located at a variety of HEIs throughout the country, from small liberal arts colleges to large research universities. Of these HEIs, 56% are private and 44% are public (Figure 1). Public higher education systems comprised 5% of the HEIs. In some cases, there were campaigns at both the campus and system level. An example is the University of California System, which committed to full divestment in 2019 after over six years of activists running both a collaborative, system-wide campaign and campaigns at the individual universities within the system [63]. This study included both the University of California system-wide campaign and campaigns at six of the universities within the system. Among other characteristics of the HEIs with campaigns in the sample, 11% are religiously affiliated, 3% are women’s colleges, and all eight Ivy League institutions were present.\n",
            "\n",
            "Campaigns are concentrated in the states along the east and west coasts of the US, particularly in the northeast (Table 1, Figure 2). The four divisions located along the east and west coasts (New England, Middle Atlantic, South Atlantic, and Pacific) contained 78% of campaigns in the sample. New England and Middle Atlantic, the two divisions in the northeast US, contained the two highest numbers of campaigns of any division, with a combined share of 42% of all campaigns. The two divisions comprising the south central US, East South Central and West South Central, contained the two lowest numbers of campaigns of any division, with a combined share of 2% of all campaigns.\n",
            "\n",
            "Sixty-one percent of campaigns described types of stakeholders that were involved with their efforts in their Facebook “About” sections. Of these campaigns, 93% mentioned having students involved. The next most common stakeholder types mentioned were faculty and alumni, each mentioned by 15% of campaigns describing stakeholders. The involvement of “community members” was mentioned by 13% of campaigns describing stakeholders, though it was unclear how this was defined by each campaign. Six percent of campaigns describing stakeholders mentioned having staff from each of their HEIs involved.\n",
            "\n",
            "The goals described by campaigns revealed some key commonalities (Table 2). In general, campaigns were broadly asking their HEIs to divest from all types of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas). Nineteen percent of campaigns specified that their HEIs should divest from the top 200 fossil fuel companies, likely in reference to the Carbon Underground 200 (CU 200) list of the top 100 coal companies and top 100 oil and gas companies, ranked by the carbon emissions potential of their reserves [64]. This list has often been used as a guide for FFD by HEIs and is considered a standard for FFD by 350.org [4,65]. Campaigns rarely extended the call for divestment to other harmful industries and investments beyond fossil fuels. Among the 3% of campaigns that did call for other types of divestment in addition to FFD, targets included the arms industry, prisons, sweatshops, and holdings in Puerto Rico’s debt. If campaigns specified whether their HEIs should divest direct investments in fossil fuel companies, indirect investments in fossil fuel companies (i.e., fossil fuel holdings tied up with other investments in externally managed funds, such as mutual funds), or both, they almost always called for both direct and indirect divestment. Campaigns commonly set a deadline by which they wanted their HEIs to complete divestment. This was most often within five years, a demand given by 23% campaigns.\n",
            "\n",
            "Reinvestment goals were mentioned by 31% of campaigns. Campaigns tended to call generally for reinvestment into sustainable or socially just funds, solutions, or other alternatives to fossil fuel investments, without giving specific demands about which funds, companies, industries, or projects they desired their HEIs to target for reinvestment. However, 8% of campaigns specified that their HEIs should reinvest into renewable or clean energy. Only 1% of campaigns emphasized that reinvestment should be directed towards their local area or community.\n",
            "\n",
            "Goals mentioned by campaigns were not limited solely to divestment and reinvestment. Other goals were mentioned by 24% of campaigns. The most common of these was educating the public about climate change and environmental issues, mentioned by 8% campaigns. Six percent of campaigns called for greater investment transparency or disclosure of investments by their HEIs. Some campaigns were also advocating for other climate or energy actions beyond divestment. This included 3% of campaigns that were calling for clean energy or emissions reductions on campus, and 4% of campaigns that mentioned advocating for climate action outside of their HEI, such as in state or national policy.\n",
            "\n",
            "All three of the major sustainability themes of environmental, social, and economic were commonly used by campaigns in their messaging. Environmental themes were the most common, being used by 81% of campaigns, followed by social themes, used by 62% of campaigns, then economic themes, used by 35% of campaigns. These themes were often used in combination with each other, with 30% of campaigns using all three major themes. Further exploration of themes revealed some key commonalities (Table 3).\n",
            "\n",
            "Sixty-nine percent of campaigns used environmental themes related to climate change. This was often in regards to the negative impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels, worsening droughts, and increases in devastating hurricanes, on communities and society. In this way, climate change often formed the frame around which social and economic factors were discussed. Although some campaigns discussed the impacts of fossil fuels on the wellbeing of the environment, such as effects on biodiversity and ecosystem health, environmental themes were more often used to connect fossil fuels to problems affecting the wellbeing and prosperity of humans.\n",
            "\n",
            "Social themes were a far-ranging category that included discussion on how fossil fuels impact human wellbeing and how divestment can contribute to the mitigation of these impacts. This included the effects of climate change on community wellbeing, human health, and the wellbeing of students after they graduate. Social themes often reflected a justice perspective, with 44% of campaigns using themes related to justice. Justice-related themes were frequently used directly in the context of environmental problems, namely climate change, and often described disproportionate impacts on certain groups of people, such as frontline communities.\n",
            "\n",
            "A small percentage of campaigns made connections to broader intersectional issues of justice. For example, 9% of campaigns connected FFD to issues of racial justice. This included campaigns that cited inspiration from the South African apartheid divestment movement. Disproportionate impacts of climate change and fossil fuels on communities of color were also recognized, though only by a few campaigns. Issues of economic justice were mentioned by 5% of campaigns, for example by discussing disproportionate environmental impacts on the poor. There were also 5% of campaigns that drew connections to issues of gender and sex-based justice, stating their support for movements against gender discrimination, against sexual assault, and for the advancement of women. Despite the connections made by some campaigns to intersectional issues of justice, there were some marginalized groups that received very few mentions, including African Americans, Indigenous Peoples, immigrants, and LGBTQ+ people. Also of note, there were no campaigns that directly referenced local environmental justice issues, such as local communities impacted by fossil fuel projects or climate change.\n",
            "\n",
            "Campaigns used economic themes to discuss both considerations for the economy as a whole and economic factors affecting their HEIs. Seventeen percent of campaigns emphasized the financial benefits of FFD to their HEIs, often making arguments about the risky nature of fossil fuel investments and that divestment could help protect their endowments from financial losses. More broadly, campaigns advocated for FFD as a means to help the economy, such as by addressing financial costs to the country from climate change and encouraging new clean energy development. Several campaigns also described FFD as an opportunity to help build a new economy centered on justice and sustainability, and move away from the extractive, inequitable economy upheld by the fossil fuel industry.\n",
            "\n",
            "Beyond the frames of the three “pillars of sustainability,” campaigns saw sustainability itself as an important theme, with 31% of campaigns using the words “sustainability” or “sustainable.” In this context, fossil fuels and the industry behind their use are deemed as inherently unsustainable, and FFD is seen as a tool for creating a more sustainable society not reliant on them. As another overarching theme, 36% of campaigns argued that FFD was in line with the values of their HEIs. For example, campaigns expressed that higher education has a responsibility to be a leader in responding to major problems like climate change. Some campaigns also argued that FFD was in line with their HEI’s mission, religious values, or established commitment to sustainability.\n",
            "\n",
            "The results provide a window into the HE FFD movement in the US, revealing some important insights about the characteristics of campaigns that have been involved.\n",
            "\n",
            "Campaigns were found to be concentrated in the states along the east and west coasts of the US, particularly in the northeast. There are many factors that may contribute to this distribution. This includes the large number of HEIs in these areas, with 53% of all degree-granting HEIs in the US located in the Census divisions on the east and west coasts and 21% located in the divisions in the northeast [72]. The high concentration of population and social activity near the US coasts [73,74], as well as strong liberal political attitudes in the northeast and on the west coast [75,76], may be additional factors. It should also be noted that Divest Ed is based in Massachusetts, which may contribute to the number of campaigns existing in the northeast and may also bias the sample to include more campaigns in the northeast, due to the connections the program has in this region.\n",
            "\n",
            "Though the high number of campaigns on the east and west coasts may arise naturally from such factors as high population levels and favorable political attitudes, the stark absence of campaigns elsewhere raises interesting questions about how such a distribution may impact the efficacy of the movement. For example, there are areas of the country known for heavy fossil fuel production where campaigns are largely absent. Most notable is the West South Central division, which contains a hotbed of oil and natural gas production within the states of Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana [77,78], yet had only one campaign in the sample. To the north, Wyoming, which accounted for 40% of US coal produced in 2018 [79], and major fracking state North Dakota both contained no campaigns in the sample [80,81]. The noticeable absence of campaigns in the south is also of note due to the fact that the southeastern US is projected to be hardest hit by many impacts of climate change, exacerbating disproportionately high poverty levels in this area [82,83,84]. If location of campaigns matters to the ability of the HE FFD movement to take on the fossil fuel industry and address the injustices of climate change, the distribution that exists does not seem to be as well poised as it could be to doing so.\n",
            "\n",
            "Campaigns that mentioned stakeholder types overwhelmingly recognized students as being involved with their efforts. This is not surprising given HE FFD’s general acceptance as primarily a student-led movement [4,16,17,29]. However, the results shed light on the common participation of other HE stakeholders, including alumni, faculty, and staff, which has been less recognized. These stakeholders have been noted as playing important supportive roles to student campaigns. For example, faculty may serve as mentors to student campaigns or sign on to letters to administrators endorsing FFD [16,50]. Alumni may leverage their standing by committing to not donate to their former HEI until it has divested or organizing concurrent initiatives to support student calls for FFD [68,85].\n",
            "\n",
            "The goals campaigns stated for FFD were generally broad, such as divestment from all types of fossil fuels, a wide contingent of the top fossil fuel companies (i.e., the CU 200), and of both direct and indirect investments. This consensus does not reflect how HEIs always act when pursuing divestment. Divestment strategies used by HEIs include divestment from all fossil fuel companies, divestment from the CU 200, and divestment from specific sectors, such as coal or tar sands; and HEIs may choose to divest from direct or both direct and indirect holdings [4,66,86]. Of US HEIs that have committed to FFD, 25% have committed to less than full forms of divestment as categorized by 350.org, including 16% of divesting HEIs that have committed solely to divestment from coal or coal and tar sands [33]. This suggests that campaigns generally advocate for the broadest form of FFD possible, while HEIs often choose more selective forms of FFD to actually pursue. In these cases, activists may continue to put pressure on HEIs for more extensive divestment [4,34,68].\n",
            "\n",
            "Results show that calls for reinvestment are common among campaigns, but these were also found to be generally broad, rather than specific of where HEIs should reinvest. As was advocated for by some campaigns in the sample, reinvestment in clean energy has been among the calls made by activists since the beginning of the movement to redirect resources towards climate solutions [30]. However, a common narrative on what reinvestment should look like does not seem to have developed within the movement. Research has suggested that reinvestment has not had as much focus in the movement as divestment because it may be strategically disadvantageous to demand it as an additional step and because of beliefs among activists that it is technically more difficult and that there are not enough appropriate funds to reinvest into [30]. However, by not incorporating specific demands for reinvestment, campaigns risk HEIs reallocating money towards greenwashed alternatives, rather than solutions that build a more just society [37]. For example, research has indicated that FFD could move investment towards sectors of the economy that still have substantial exposure to greenhouse gas emissions, even when investing in “fossil free” funds [87,88].\n",
            "\n",
            "The additional goals mentioned by nearly a quarter of campaigns, such as educating the public and advocating for climate action beyond the institution, demonstrate that groups working on FFD are not motivated solely by divestment and reinvestment and contribute in other valuable ways. This may reflect the multitude of ways in which students engage with sustainability movements on campus and within society [19].\n",
            "\n",
            "Campaigns often used a combination of environmental, social, and economic themes in their messaging, reinforcing the notion of FFD fitting within the realm of sustainability, which can be described as the intersection of these areas [60,61]. Fossil fuels were presented as a key driver of environmental, social, and economic problems, namely climate change and its impacts on humans. FFD was seen as a tool to incite a transition away from fossil fuels and thus create a more sustainable society. Campaigns often saw it as the duty of their HEIs to help facilitate this transition because of their institutional values and important position within society. This aligns with the position of scholars who view FFD as a necessary direction for HE sustainability in the era of climate change that embraces more outward, transformative action, grounded in principles of equity and social justice [4,16,17,86,89].\n",
            "\n",
            "True to the common narrative of HE FFD being a movement for justice, nearly half of campaigns incorporated language that framed their motivations around issues of justice, often in relation to the disproportionate impacts of climate change on certain groups of people. Some campaigns went beyond simply framing FFD as a justice issue and connected it to broader intersectional issues, such as racial or economic justice. However, there was still a lack of intersectionality in terms of connecting FFD to issues faced by specific marginalized groups, such as African Americans and Indigenous Peoples. Interestingly, while less than 1% of campaigns in this study directly addressed Indigenous issues, Maina et al. (2020) found that nearly 30% of Canadian HE FFD campaigns incorporate site-specific messaging addressing concerns of Indigenous groups, suggesting that Canadian campaigns have developed stronger connections with Indigenous groups than have campaigns in the US [29].\n",
            "\n",
            "Campaigns’ arguments mostly rested on the moral imperative of acting to mitigate societal crises, but a practical case was also often made on the grounds that FFD could benefit HEIs financially, such as by avoiding losses due to the riskiness of fossil fuel investments. The argument of fossil fuel companies being risky investments is often associated with the FFD movement, particularly the idea that fossil fuel stocks will become obsolete, or “stranded assets,” as increased regulations require fossil fuels to be kept in the ground to mitigate climate change [4,30,48,89]. Campaigns may showcase these arguments to appease concerns of administrators, who have been shown to commonly cite the financial benefits or risks to their HEIs in decisions committing to or rejecting FFD [4,17,49].\n",
            "\n",
            "It should be emphasized that campaigns have not developed their goals and messaging in isolation but have likely been highly influenced by each other and the narratives presented by organizations supporting FFD. Maina et al., (2020) found “patterns of imitation” in the Canadian HE FFD movement in which campaigns borrowed messaging and tactics from each other in accordance with what was needed for the local context of their HEIs. They were also influenced by organizations such as 350.org, who provided online or in-person “sites of encounter” where ideas and resources were shared and disseminated among activists [29]. This phenomena of diffusion of ideas and practices among movement actors has been well documented within past social movements [90,91,92].\n",
            "\n",
            "The commonalities seen in this study among campaign’s goals and the themes they used likely to some degree reflect a similar process of adopting objectives and messaging of other campaigns and organizations in the movement. For example, the request promoted by 350.org for HEIs to “immediately freeze any new investment in fossil fuel companies, and divest from direct ownership and any commingled funds that include fossil fuel public equities and corporate bonds within 5 years” became the baseline demand from campaigns early in the movement [25]. This was repeated almost word for word by a number of campaigns in this study and reflects the common goals of divestment from all types of fossil fuels, divestment of both direct and indirect fossil fuel investments, and completion of divestment within five years. Though campaigns arise and organize in a decentralized fashion, they still seem to form a unified movement with common goals and messaging through imitation and the influence of organizations.\n",
            "\n",
            "This study provides an overview and analysis of the characteristics of US HE FFD campaigns, focused on the locations and types of institutions where campaigns occur, the stakeholders involved in campaigns and the goals they adopt, and the themes campaigns use in their messaging. Presented as ten years of campaigns organizing for FFD at HEIs approaches, this offers an important contribution, allowing an understanding of the nature of campaigns so far. However, there are still directions for future research that could be useful for better understanding the movement in the US.\n",
            "\n",
            "There is a lack of clarity on how campaigns engage with and are influenced by the communities and regions in which they are located. Unlike actors in the grassroots environmental justice movement that the HE FFD movement takes inspiration from [40], the findings reveal that campaigns are not highly focused on pollution or inequities in their own areas. For example, no campaigns referenced local environmental justice issues and few demanded reinvestment into their local communities. However, this study was limited by only looking at short descriptions on campaigns’ Facebook pages, and there are certainly nuances to how campaigns interact with their local contexts that were not observed. Whether campaigns are inspired to organize by local environmental issues, how campaigns build solidarity with local disenfranchised communities, and whether campaigns or FFD commitments at HEIs have a reputational or financial impact on fossil fuel companies with operations in their respective regions would all be useful questions to explore. For example, these would help to better explain the spatial pattern of campaigns and whether campaigns could be more strategically located throughout the US.\n",
            "\n",
            "Reinvestment is also an area that has received very little study. There are few sources of information that describe where HEIs have reinvested or committed to reinvest after FFD, beyond broad generalizations and a few mentions of specific cases. A comprehensive examination of where HEIs are reinvesting could be particularly insightful now, as some of the earlier divesting HEIs have had time to reallocate divested funds and research could help to understand where this money has gone. Though this study has suggested that campaigns do not tend to include specific targets for reinvestment in their demands, further exploration of how campaigns engage with the notion of reinvestment would be of interest to better understand the role it plays in campaigns and how activists are articulating a pathway for just reallocation of money currently invested in the fossil fuel industry.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, most scholars have considered HE FFD from an isolated perspective in regard to other social movements. The results of this study pointed to some intersections between HE FFD and other social movements, such as with campaigns tying FFD to racial or economic justice issues. However, there is still a need to examine how HE FFD has been influenced by past social movements and interacts with current ones. Particularly, as movements addressing race and diversity like Black Lives Matter have found support from student activists in recent years [51], further study of the connections between these movements and HE FFD would be illuminating to the understanding of how it fits in with the broader sphere of progressive activism at HEIs.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is clear from the analysis of campaigns’ goals and messaging that the HE FFD movement is pushing sustainability and climate action towards a greater embrace of systemic change and social justice. Nowhere is this more evident than within HE itself, where HEIs are being challenged to uphold their duty as influential societal actors by moving beyond incremental campus greening and engaging in a broader political arena of sustainability action with climate justice as the goal. HE professionals should take note of what campaigns are demanding and consider critically how the approach to sustainability at their own HEIs can better work to encourage the just economic transition needed to address climate change at the scale and speed necessary, through actions like FFD.\n",
            "\n",
            "The results point to some ways in which the US HE FFD movement could be further developed to better confront the power of the fossil fuel industry and build capacity for a movement away from the extractive economy based in solidarity with impacted communities. For example, HE FFD organizers could work to build connections in areas that have not seen much activity, particularly in states with heavy fossil fuel production like Texas and North Dakota, to encourage and support the development of campaigns at HEIs there. As more HEIs commit to FFD and proceed with the divestment process, more focus may need to be devoted towards developing a consistent narrative within the movement around reinvestment to ensure that money is reallocated towards a more just economy, and not simply into greenwashed alternative investments. Finally, greater emphasis may need to be applied to solidarity with frontline and marginalized communities to develop the movement’s focus on justice. In particular, campaigns developing relationships with such communities within the localities of their HEIs may provide opportunities to draw needed attention to specific cases of injustice and even to support the prosperity and self-determination of these communities through community reinvestment initiatives.\n",
            "\n",
            "Through wide-spread mobilization, a hardline stance against investments in the fossil fuel industry, and a propensity to focus on justice for the people most impacted by the climate crisis, HE FFD campaigns in the US have initiated a movement that has helped define an insurgent international wave of climate activism and has challenged embedded notions of sustainability. Led primarily by students, the movement is also empowering young people to engage in collective action for sustainability with aims that are radical and global in scope. At the beginning of a new decade, the movement continues to grow and hold significant power to undermine the dominance of the fossil fuel industry, shape narratives around climate change and sustainability, and ultimately drive a transition to a more just society. It is in the hands of future generations of activists, HEIs, and others involved in the movement to determine the impact HE FFD will have in the coming years.\n",

Part two develops a concept of policy capacity that can fruitfully guide longitudinal and cross-sectional studies of local environmental protection activities in the United States. Part three draws attention to local environmental policy outputs and outcomes in California as an illustrative example of the policy capacity framework, showing that environmental protection policies and collective actions vary substantially from county to county in ways that can be captured by the indicators of local policy capacity.\n",

            "Helen Yost, a 62-year-old environmental educator, has been a committed activist for nearly a decade. She says she spends 60 to 80 hours a week as a community organizer for Wild Idaho Rising Tide. She’s been arrested twice for engaging in non-violent civil disobedience.\n",
            "\n",
            "Yost may not fit the profile of a domestic terrorist, but in 2014 the FBI classified her as a potential threat to national security. According to hundreds of pages of FBI files obtained by the Guardian through a Freedom of Information Act (Foia) lawsuit, and interviews with activists, Yost and more than a dozen other people campaigning against fossil fuel extraction in North America have been identified in domestic terrorism-related investigations.\n",
            "\n",
            "The investigations, which targeted individual activists and some environmental organizations, were opened in 2013-2014, at the height of opposition to the Keystone XL Pipeline and the expansion of fossil fuel production in North America.\n",
            "\n",
            "The new Foia documents reveal the bureau’s motivation for investigating a broad cross-section of the environmental movement and its characterization of non-violent protesters as a potential threat to national security.\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2010, the DoJ’s inspector general criticized the FBI for using non-violent civil disobedience as grounds to open domestic terrorism investigations. US citizens swept up in such investigations can be placed on terrorism watchlists and subjected to surveillance and restrictions on international travel. The designation can also lead local law enforcement to take a more confrontational approach when engaging with non-violent activists.\n",
            "\n",
            "The FBI’s 2013-2014 investigation of Keystone XL activists in Houston violated internal agency guidelines designed to prevent the bureau from infringing on constitutionally protected activities. The investigations opened in 2013-2014 were closed after the FBI concluded that the individuals and organizations had not engaged in criminal activity and did not a pose a threat to national security.\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2015, the Obama administration rejected the Keystone XL pipeline project, which required state department approval because it would cross international borders, handing the environmental movement a major victory. More large-scale protests followed, including the standoff over the Dakota Access pipeline, which temporarily delayed the project.\n",
            "\n",
            "But those decisions have been reversed in recent years. Donald Trump has approved construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, and his administration has also advocated for stiffer penalties against activists who engage in non-violent direct action targeting fossil fuel infrastructure. Meanwhile, in the wake of the Standing Rock protests, seven states have passed legislation making it a crime to trespass on property containing critical infrastructure.\n",
            "\n",
            "In its July 2014 file on Yost, the FBI cited federal anti-terrorism legislation prohibiting “attacks and other violence against railroad carriers” as the primary justification for opening the investigation. Violation of the law can lead to up to 20 years in prison. Activists who engage in non-violent civil disobedience and are charged with minor offenses such as trespassing are typically released within 48 hours.\n",
            "\n",
            "The FBI characterized Yost as being driven by a “desire to stop fossil fuels which, in her political view, are destroying parts of the US, specifically Montana, Idaho and Washington”. In addition, the FBI discussed the case with the US attorney’s office in Idaho, local law enforcement, and BNSF Railway, which operates the main rail line delivering coal and oil to export terminals in the Pacific north-west.\n",
            "\n",
            "According to the FBI file, the bureau opened the investigation based on information that Yost “was organizing and planning on conducting illegal activities against railroad companies from Montana into Idaho and Washington”.\n",
            "\n",
            "Yost said Wild Idaho Rising Tide (WIRT) never organized direct action protests to disrupt oil train traffic passing in the region. The heavily redacted Yost investigation concludes that “no potential criminal violations or priority threats to national security warranting further investigation were identified”.\n",
            "\n",
            "WIRT did participate in a series of community-led events and workshops in July and August 2014 opposing the transport of oil and coal by rail. “Investigators may have conflated several community events to assume such fictitious allegations,” Yost said in an email.\n",
            "\n",
            "For several years, WIRT, founded in 2011, had been publicizing its actions on the organization’s Facebook page. Much of its activity had focused on stopping the passage of huge trucks known as megaloads, which transport processing equipment to tar sands oil fields in Canada and weigh hundreds of thousands of pounds, along one of Idaho’s scenic byways.\n",
            "\n",
            "Yost was also active in protesting against the shipment of coal and oil by rail to export terminals in Seattle. In the summer of 2014, WIRT, along with several other environmental organizations and native groups across the Pacific north-west, sponsored a series of rallies and workshops in the region.\n",
            "\n",
            "Those protests were peaceful – a handful of activists in Montana including the environmental writer Rick Bass were arrested for trespassing – and in the end the FBI concluded that Yost did not pose a threat to national security. Several months later the investigation was closed.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, in the file closing the case, it appears that Yost has been watchlisted, which is standard for named subjects of FBI domestic terrorism investigations, according to Mike German, a former FBI agent who is now a fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice. Being watchlisted can lead to heightened scrutiny from law enforcement and delays or additional screenings when traveling. Yost said she had not traveled overseas since the FBI investigation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Yost, who was contacted by an FBI agent when the case was still active, said she was not surprised by the agency’s actions. Surveillance was a form of suppression, she said, and this was another attempt to criminalize the actions of “normal people” working to protect natural resources. But she remains undeterred.\n",
            "\n",
            "Herb Goodwin, a 70-year-old activist, has a similar philosophy. “We’re all under surveillance,” Goodwin said. “If they want to look at your stuff, they’re going to.”\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2013-2014 Goodwin frequently participated in actions organized by Yost and WIRT. He was also part of the Occupy Wall Street protests in Bellingham, Washington, in 2011 and was one of 12 individuals arrested that year for blockading a BNSF coal train passing through the city. They became known as the Bellingham 12.\n",
            "\n",
            "Goodwin was one of at least a dozen environmental activists, many of them affiliated with the group Deep Green Resistance, contacted by FBI agents in autumn 2014. In early October that year, not long after Goodwin returned from a megaload resistance campaign in Idaho, an FBI agent and a police intelligence officer showed up at his residence. According to Goodwin, they wanted to ask him questions about the environmental group Deep Green Resistance. Goodwin refused to cooperate and referred the agents to his lawyer, who himself became a subject of interest to the FBI.\n",
            "\n",
            "Founded in 2011 Deep Green Resistance (DGR), based on the principles laid out in the book of the same name, describes itself as a radical organization that “uses direct action in the fight to save the planet”. Though the group supports underground movements, its members abide by a code of conduct that includes a commitment to nonviolence and operating entirely above-ground. According to the group’s website, “We do not want to be involved in or aware of any underground organizing.” In another FBI interview with a DGR member documented in the files, the activist even invited the agents to attend one of DGR’s presentations.\n",
            "\n",
            "FBI files show that the bureau initiated the two-year investigation into DGR to determine if the group or any of its members were planning to engage in the destruction of energy facilities or attacks against railroad companies, referring to the same federal statute cited in the Yost investigation.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the FBI also took an interest in constitutionally protected activities, including DGR members’ participation in public meetings and lectures and the group’s early organizing efforts.\n",
            "\n",
            "Even though the FBI investigation found no evidence that DGR was planning to engage in violent activity, it often portrayed the group as an extremist organization. One individual contacted numerous times by the FBI was said to have been a “suspected member of the Deep Green Resistance’s extremist wing” and a participant in DGR’s “Midwest extremist planning process”. DGR did have a strategic planning conference in Wisconsin in spring 2012 which they said was attended by about 30 people, but it was publicly advertised and focused on building the organization, fundraising and leadership training.\n",
            "\n",
            "The FBI also focused its attention on DGR organizing at Western Washington University, which hosted a lecture in 2011 by two of the group’s members, Max Wilbert and Dillon Thomson. Information about the lecture, titled Environmentalism for the New Century, and about the professor who hosted it was included in the FBI files. Wilbert, who attended WWU, is also a member of DGR’s board of directors.\n",
            "\n",
            "As part of the investigation, the FBI met with the university’s police department to “discuss possible Deep Green Resistance presence on the WWU campus”. The FBI also said it would attempt to determine whether any of the professors in the environmental sciences department were involved in the “DGR movement”.\n",
            "\n",
            "The sweeping investigation into DGR’s activities was formally closed in 2014 but Wilbert assumes that the group is still being closely watched. Wilbert, who is also a writer and photographer, frequently posts short polemical essays on his Facebook page or the Deep Green Resistance website.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wilbert said that on 7 September 2018, nearly four years after the investigation was closed, he got a call from an FBI agent in Seattle informing him that the bureau had received an anonymous tip regarding something he had written online. The agent also left a card at Wilbert’s parents’ home.\n",
            "\n",
            "“I’m pretty outspoken about being a revolutionary, somebody who believes in the necessity for revolutionary change,” Wilbert said. “It’s not something I hide.”\n",
            "\n",
            "German, the former FBI agent, whose recent book, Disrupt, Discredit, and Divide, chronicles the troubling post-9/11 expansion of the FBI’s domestic surveillance powers, said the agency had failed to heed the warnings laid out in a 2010 justice department IG investigation that criticized the FBI’s targeting of certain domestic advocacy groups. According to German, the Yost files and the two-year DGR investigation show how “ineffective these internal oversight mechanisms are to preventing abusive and wasteful investigations of non-violent protesters”.\n",

            "The hackers, dubbed “Dark Basin”, went after thousands of individuals and hundreds of institutions on six continents, including advocacy organizations, journalists, elected officials and businesses, said the Citizen Lab, a Toronto-based digital espionage research group.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Citizen Lab links the hacking efforts to BellTroX InfoTech Services, an Indian company which has denied any wrongdoing. The research report said: “The extensive targeting of American nonprofits exercising their first amendment rights is exceptionally troubling.”\n",
            "\n",
            "“Everyone is familiar with getting phishing and spam emails in their mailbox all the time,” said John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab. “The difference is that in this case the people behind them are not just faceless cyber-criminals looking to steal your Gmail account and use it to spam your friends about time shares and penis pills. This is people who have been sent after you with specific objectives to get information that is going to be used to harm you.”\n",

            "\n",
            "The delays are partly due to the prison system struggling to cope with high numbers and a judicial system under severe funding and other constraints, as well as a huge backlog of cases resulting from the Covid lockdowns.

Nearly every labor union joined the march, including the Service Employees International Union, the largest union in the city. The march was supposed to start at 59th Street, but the throng of people stretched past 93rd Street, and there were so many marchers that it took the back of the line over two hours to start moving. The march was so well attended that organizers had to send a text at 5 p.m., asking marchers to leave because the route had filled to capacity.\n",

            "“Moving to New Orleans really politicized me about climate change, since the Gulf Coast is predicted to have the worst sea-level rise,” said Davidson’s classmate, Emma Collin, 21. “It’s like being in Rome before the fall.”\n",

            "Due to the embrace of modern portfolio theory, most of the stock market is controlled by institutional investors holding broadly diversified economy-mirroring portfolios. Recent scholarship has revealed the anti-competitive incentives that arise when a firm’s largest shareholders own similarly sized stakes in the firm’s industry competitors. This Article expands the consideration of the effects of common ownership from the industry level to the market-portfolio level, and argues that diversified investors should rationally be motivated to internalize intra-portfolio negative externalities. This portfolio perspective can explain the increasing climate change related activism of institutional investors, who have applied coordinated shareholder power to pressure fossil fuel producers into substantially reducing greenhouse gas emissions.While institutional investors have protested their ability to influence firm-level supply and pricing decisions in the service of muting competition, they are more willing to advertise their role in seeking emissions reduction commitments, even admitting they are for the benefit of portfolio returns. These commitments, however, affect product supply and imply market power in much the same way, and provide further evidence that institutional investors are able to influence managerial decisions at the firm level for the benefit of their broader portfolio. This insight requires the amendment of the traditional view that diversified investors are “rationally reticent” and lack the incentive to engage in monitoring of firm behavior. It additionally challenges a fundamental norm of corporate governance law: the theory of shareholder primacy rests on the premise that shareholders homogeneously seek to maximize corporate profits and share value. This Article shows that in certain circumstances a majority of minority shareholders may direct the firm away from a profit-maximizing objective.\n",

Do we have enough raw materials? “We looked at that in some detail and we aren’t too worried,” says Jacobson. “For instance, you need neodymium for wind turbines—but there’s seven times more of it than you’d need to power half the world.

To match the flow of panels needed to meet the Stanford targets, in the most intense years of construction we need to erect 30 of these solar panel factories a year, plus another 15 for making wind turbines. “It’s at the upper end of what I could possibly imagine,” Solomon says.\n",

Their PR departments also put out their own radio serials with titles like “Victory Is Their Business,” and “War of Enterprise,” and published endless newspaper ads boasting of their own patriotism. In reality, many of America’s captains of industry didn’t want much to do with the war until they were dragooned into it. Henry Ford, who built and managed that Ypsilanti bomber plant, was an America Firster who urged his countrymen to stay out of the war; the Chamber of Commerce (now a leading opponent of climate action) fought to block FDR’s Lend-Lease program to help the imperiled British. “American businessmen oppose American involvement in any foreign war,” the Chamber’s president explained to Congress.\n",

They placed the contracts, they moved the stuff around.” The feds acted aggressively—they would cancel contracts as war needs changed, tossing factories full of people abruptly out of work. If firms refused to take direction, FDR ordered many of them seized. Though companies made money, there was little in the way of profiteering—bad memories from World War I, Wilson says, led to “robust profit controls,” which were mostly accepted by America’s industrial tycoons. In many cases, federal authorities purposely set up competition between public operations and private factories: The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard built submarines, but so did Electric Boat of Groton, Connecticut. “They were both quite impressive and productive,” Wilson says.\n",

So they’re willing to do this kind of pragmatic trial and error.

And the modest “operations researchers,” who had entered and learned from the real world when they managed radar development during the war, retreated to their ivory towers and became much grander “systems analysts” once the conflict ended. Robert McNamara, a former Ford executive, brought an entire wing of the Rand Corporation to the Defense Department during the Kennedy administration, where the think-tank experts promptly privatized most of the government shipyards and plane factories, and used their out-of-touch computer models to screw up government programs like Model Cities, the ambitious attempt at urban rehabilitation during the War on Poverty. “The systems analysts completely took over,” Berk says, “and the program largely failed for that reason.”\n",

It is a world war. Its first victims, ironically, are those who have done the least to cause the crisis. But it’s a world war aimed at us all.

The world came back from signing the climate accord in Paris last December exactly as Chamberlain returned from Munich: hopeful, even exhilarated, that a major threat had finally been tackled. Paul Krugman, summing up the world’s conventional wisdom, post-Paris, concluded that climate change “can be avoided with fairly modest, politically feasible steps. You may want a revolution, but we don’t need one to save the planet.” All it would take, he insisted, is for America to implement Obama’s plan for clean power, and to continue “guiding the world as a whole toward sharp reductions in emissions,” as it had in Paris.\n",

            "This is, simply put, as wrong as Chamberlain’s “peace in our time.” Even if every nation in the world complies with the Paris Agreement, the world will heat up by as much as 3.5 degrees Celsius by 2100—not the 1.5 to 2 degrees promised in the pact’s preamble. And it may be too late already to meet that stated target: We actually flirted with that 1.5 degree line at the height of the El Niño warming in February, a mere 60 days after the world’s governments solemnly pledged their best efforts to slow global warming. Our leaders have been anticipating what French strategists in World War II called the guerre du longue durée, even as each new edition of Science or Nature makes clear that climate change is mounting an all-out blitzkrieg, setting new record highs for global temperatures in each of the past 14 months.\n",

For years now, climate scientists and leading economists have called for treating climate change with the same resolve we brought to bear on Germany and Japan in the last world war. In July, the Democratic Party issued a platform that called for a World War II–type national mobilization to save civilization from the “catastrophic consequences” of a “global climate emergency.” In fact, Hillary Clinton’s negotiators agreed to plans for an urgent summit “in the first hundred days of the next administration” where the president will convene “the world’s best engineers, climate scientists, policy experts, activists, and indigenous communities to chart a course to solve the climate crisis.”\n",

            "But would the Stanford plan be enough to slow global warming? Yes, says Jacobson: If we move quickly enough to meet the goal of 80 percent clean power by 2030, then the world’s carbon dioxide levels would fall below the relative safety of 350 parts per million by the end of the century. The planet would stop heating up, or at least the pace of that heating would slow substantially. That’s as close to winning this war as we could plausibly get. We’d endure lots of damage in the meantime, but not the civilization-scale destruction we currently face. (Even if all of the world’s nations meet the pledges they made in the Paris accord, carbon dioxide is currently on a path to hit 500 or 600 parts per million by century’s end—a path if not to hell, then to someplace with a similar setting on the thermostat.)\n",

            "To make the Stanford plan work, you would need to build a hell of a lot of factories to turn out thousands of acres of solar panels, and wind turbines the length of football fields, and millions and millions of electric cars and buses. But here again, experts have already begun to crunch the numbers. Tom Solomon, a retired engineer who oversaw the construction of one of the largest factories built in recent years—Intel’s mammoth Rio Rancho semiconductor plant in New Mexico—took Jacobson’s research and calculated how much clean energy America would need to produce by 2050 to completely replace fossil fuels. The answer: 6,448 gigawatts.\n",
            "\n",
            "So Solomon did the math to figure out how many factories it would take to produce 6,448 gigawatts of clean energy in the next 35 years. He started by looking at SolarCity, a clean-energy company that is currently building the nation’s biggest solar panel factory in Buffalo. “They’re calling it the giga-factory,” Solomon says, “because the panels it builds will produce one gigawatt worth of solar power every year.” Using the SolarCity plant as a rough yardstick, Solomon calculates that America needs 295 solar factories of a similar size to defeat climate change—roughly six per state—plus a similar effort for wind turbines.\n",

            "In 1941, the world’s largest industrial plant under a single roof went up in six months near Ypsilanti, Michigan; Charles Lindbergh called it the “Grand Canyon of the mechanized world.” Within months, it was churning out a B-24 Liberator bomber every hour. Bombers! Huge, complicated planes, endlessly more intricate than solar panels or turbine blades—containing 1,225,000 parts, 313,237 rivets. Nearby, in Warren, Michigan, the Army built a tank factory faster than they could build the power plant to run it—so they simply towed a steam locomotive into one end of the building to provide steam heat and electricity. That one factory produced more tanks than the Germans built in the entire course of the war.\n",

            "Today we live in the privatized, siloed, business-dominated world that took root under McNamara and flourished under Reagan. The actual wars we fight are marked by profiteering, and employ as many private contractors as they do soldiers. Our spirit of social solidarity is, to put it mildly, thin. (The modern-day equivalent of Father Coughlin is now the Republican candidate for president.) So it’s reasonable to ask if we can find the collective will to fight back in this war against global warming, as we once fought fascism.\n",
            "\n",
            "For starters, it’s important to remember that a truly global mobilization to defeat climate change wouldn’t wreck our economy or throw coal miners out of work. Quite the contrary: Gearing up to stop global warming would provide a host of social and economic benefits, just as World War II did. It would save lives. (A worldwide switch to renewable energy would cut air pollution deaths by 4 to 7 million a year, according to the Stanford data.) It would produce an awful lot of jobs. (An estimated net gain of roughly two million in the United States alone.) It would provide safer, better-paying employment to energy workers. (A new study by Michigan Technological University found that we could retrain everyone in the coal fields to work in solar power for as little as $181 million, and the guy installing solar panels on a roof averages about $4,000 more a year than the guy risking his life down in the hole.) It would rescue the world’s struggling economies. (British economist Nicholas Stern calculates that the economic impacts of unchecked global warming could far exceed those of the world wars or the Great Depression.) And fighting this war would be socially transformative. (Just as World War II sped up the push for racial and gender equality, a climate campaign should focus its first efforts on the frontline communities most poisoned by the fossil fuel era. It would help ease income inequality with higher employment, revive our hollowed-out rural states with wind farms, and transform our decaying suburbs with real investments in public transit.)\n",
            "\n",
            "There are powerful forces, of course, that stand in the way of a full-scale mobilization. If you add up every last coal mine and filling station in the world, governments and corporations have spent $20 trillion on fossil fuel infrastructure. “No country will walk away from such investments,” writes Vaclav Smil, a Canadian energy expert. As investigative journalists have shown over the past year, the oil giant Exxon knew all about global warming for decades—yet spent millions to spread climate-denial propaganda. The only way to overcome that concerted opposition—from the very same industrial forces that opposed America’s entry into World War II—is to adopt a wartime mentality, rewriting the old mindset that stands in the way of victory. “The first step is we have to win,” says Jonathan Koomey, an energy researcher at Stanford University. “That is, we have to have broad acceptance among the broader political community that we need urgent action, not just nibbling around the edges, which is what the D.C. crowd still thinks.”\n",
            "\n",
            "That political will is starting to build, just as it began to gather in the years before Pearl Harbor. A widespread movement has killed off the Keystone pipeline, stymied Arctic drilling, and banned fracking in key states and countries. As one oil industry official lamented in July, “The ‘keep-it-in-the-ground’ campaign” has “controlled the conversation.” This resembles, at least a little, the way FDR actually started gearing up for war 18 months before the “date which will live in infamy.” The ships and planes that won the Battle of Midway six months into 1942 had all been built before the Japanese attacked Hawaii. “By the time of Pearl Harbor,” Wilson says, “the government had pretty much solved the problem of organization. After that, they just said, ‘We’re going to have to make twice as much.’”\n",
            "\n",
            "Pearl Harbor did make individual Americans willing to do hard things: pay more in taxes, buy billions upon billions in war bonds, endure the shortages and disruptions that came when the country’s entire economy converted to wartime production. Use of public transit went up 87 percent during the war, as Naomi Klein points out in This Changes Everything; 40 percent of the nation’s vegetables were grown in victory gardens. For the first time, women and minorities were able to get good factory jobs; Rosie the Riveter changed our sense of what was possible.\n",
            "\n",
            "Without a Pearl Harbor, in fact, there was only so much even FDR could have accomplished. So far, there has been no equivalent in the climate war—no single moment that galvanizes the world to realize that nothing short of total war will save civilization. Perhaps the closest we’ve come to FDR’s “date of infamy” speech—and it wasn’t all that close—was when Bernie Sanders, in the first debate, was asked to name the biggest security threat facing the planet. “Climate change,” he replied—prompting all the usual suspects to tut-tut that he was soft on “radical Islamic terrorism.” Then, in the second debate, the question came up again, a day after the Paris massacres. “Do you still believe that?” the moderator asked, in gotcha mode. “Absolutely,” replied Sanders, who then proceeded to give an accurate account of how record drought will lead to international instability.\n",
            "\n",
            "Had he won, it’s possible that Bernie could have combined his focus on jobs and climate and infrastructure into some kind of overarching effort that really mattered—he was, after all, the presidential candidate most comfortable with big government since FDR. Donald Trump, of course, will dodge this war just as he did Vietnam. He thinks (if that’s actually the right verb) that climate change is a hoax manufactured by the Chinese, who apparently in their Oriental slyness convinced the polar ice caps to go along with their conspiracy. Clinton’s advisers originally promised there would be a “climate war room” in her White House, but then corrected the record: It would actually be a “climate map room,” which sounds somewhat less gung ho.\n",
            "\n",
            "In fact, one of the lowest points in my years of fighting climate change came in late June, when I sat on the commission appointed to draft the Democratic Party platform. (I was a Sanders appointee, alongside Cornel West and other luminaries.) At 11 p.m. on a Friday night, in a mostly deserted hotel ballroom in St. Louis, I was given an hour to offer nine amendments to the platform to address climate change. More bike paths passed by unanimous consent, but all the semi-hard things that might begin to make a real difference—a fracking ban, a carbon tax, a prohibition against drilling or mining fossil fuels on public lands, a climate litmus test for new developments, an end to World Bank financing of fossil fuel plants—were defeated by 7–6 tallies, with the Clinton appointees voting as a bloc. They were quite concerned about climate change, they insisted, but a “phased-down” approach would be best. There was the faintest whiff of Munich about it. Like Chamberlain, these were all good and concerned people, just the sort of steady, evenhanded folks you’d like to have leading your nation in normal times. But they misunderstood the nature of the enemy. Like fascism, climate change is one of those rare crises that gets stronger if you don’t attack. In every war, there are very real tipping points, past which victory, or even a draw, will become impossible. And when the enemy manages to decimate some of the planet’s oldest and most essential physical features—a polar ice cap, say, or the Pacific’s coral reefs—that’s a pretty good sign that a tipping point is near. In this war that we’re in—the war that physics is fighting hard, and that we aren’t—winning slowly is exactly the same as losing.\n",

            "To my surprise, things changed a couple weeks later, when the final deliberations over the Democratic platform were held in Orlando. While Clinton’s negotiators still wouldn’t support a ban on fracking or a carbon tax, they did agree we needed to “price” carbon, that wind and sun should be given priority over natural gas, and that any federal policy that worsened global warming should be rejected.\n",

            "Maybe it was polls showing that Bernie voters—especially young ones—have been slow to sign on to the Clinton campaign. Maybe the hottest June in American history had opened some minds. But you could, if you squinted, create a hopeful scenario. Clinton, for instance, promised that America will install half a billion solar panels in the next four years. That’s not so far off the curve that Tom Solomon calculates we need to hit. And if we do it by building solar factories of our own, rather than importing cheap foreign-made panels, we’ll be positioning America as the world’s dominant power in clean energy, just as our mobilization in World War II ensured our economic might for two generations. If we don’t get there first, others will: Driven by anger over smog-choked cities, the Chinese have already begun installing renewable energy at a world-beating rate.\n",

The president could immediately put a halt to drilling and mining on public lands and waters, which contain at least half of all the untapped carbon left in America. She could slow the build-out of the natural gas system simply by correcting the outmoded way the EPA calculates the warming effect of methane, just as Obama reined in coal-fired power plants. She could tell her various commissioners to put a stop to the federal practice of rubber-stamping new fossil fuel projects, rejecting those that would “significantly exacerbate” global warming. She could instruct every federal agency to buy all their power from green sources and rely exclusively on plug-in cars, creating new markets overnight. She could set a price on carbon for her agencies to follow internally, even without the congressional action that probably won’t be forthcoming. And just as FDR brought in experts from the private sector to plan for the defense build-out, she could get the blueprints for a full-scale climate mobilization in place even as she rallies the political will to make them plausible. Without the same urgency and foresight displayed by FDR—without immediate executive action—we will lose this war.\n",

She demanded that the Swedish government reduce carbon emissions. Her actions inspired student strikes in over 270 cities around the world.\n",
            "\n",
            "Speaking on behalf of Climate Justice Now, Thunberg chastised the delegates and member nations for failing to take action appropriate to the climate crisis: “Until you start focusing on what needs to be done rather than what is politically possible, there is no hope. We can’t solve a crisis without treating it as a crisis. We need to keep the fossil fuels in the ground.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Thunberg pointed out that “if solutions within the system are so impossible to find, maybe we should change the system itself,” and she spoke directly to the errors and injustice of our economic system. “Our biosphere is being sacrificed so that rich people in countries like mine can live in luxury. It is the sufferings of the many which pay for the luxuries of the few.”\n",
            "\n",
            "She exposed the errors of convenient but false solutions that have displaced the genuine solutions to climate change and ecological collapse. “You only speak of green eternal economic growth because you are too scared of being unpopular,” she said. “You only talk about moving forward with the same bad ideas that got us into this mess, even when the only sensible thing to do is pull the emergency brake.”\n",

            "“We’ve had thirty years of pep-talking and selling positive ideas,” she said in Stockholm prior to departing for Poland, “And I’m sorry, but it doesn’t work. Because if it would have, the emissions would have gone down by now — they haven’t.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Meanwhile, outside the conference, 330 organizations from 129 countries presented six “People’s Demands for Climate Justice,” beginning with “Keep fossil fuels in the ground and end subsidies to fossil fuel industry”.\n",
            "\n",
            "The youth leaders urged nations to “reject false solutions” — techno-fixes and offsetting schemes — in favour of “real solutions that are just, feasible, and essential.”  They particularly called out corporations and rich nations, who use the excuse of carbon sinks to seize indigenous land.\n",
            "\n",

            "Finally, the coalition demanded that UN conferences end “corporate interference” and sabotage of the climate talks. Extraction corporations “have been getting massively wealthy,” said Sriram Madhusoodanan from Corporate Accountability. “They’re in these talks, blocking real solutions and advancing false solutions that will continue to propagate their business model.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Thunberg is correct about years, decades, of pep-talks and positive ideas that have failed to reduce carbon emissions. Scientists have known about the threat of global heating since Thunberg’s ancestor, Arrhenius calculated the impact in the nineteenth century. The modern world has been meeting about the crisis for almost forty years, since the first World Climate Conference in Geneva in 1979. Since then, human carbon emissions have doubled from about 5 gigatonnes of carbon per year (GtC/yr) to 2018’s record-breaking 10.88 GtC/yr. Meanwhile, CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has grown by 22%, from 337 parts per million (ppm) in 1979 to over 412 ppm today. These results represent an enormous failure on the part of world governments.\n",
            "\n",
            "She is also correct about the unfulfilled promise of “green growth,” a notion made popular in 2012, at the UN Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro, by the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, both dedicated to industrial growth.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, recent studies show that “green” or “sustainable” growth are delusions. In 2018, anthropologist Jason Hickel reviewed recent data and wrote in Foreign Policy that “green growth .. is based more on wishful thinking than on evidence.” A 2012 study by German resource economist Monika Dittrich and colleagues showed that even under optimum conditions, decoupling economic growth from resource use has not occurred. The United Nations Environment Programme came to similar conclusions in 2016 and 2017 studies. They predicted  that by 2050, with continued growth, resource use would double to 180 billion metric tons per year (Gt/y). Ecological footprint data shows that a sustainable level of resource use is about 50 Gt/y, a limit breached in 2000.\n",
            "\n",
            "Studies have consistently and rigidly linked economic growth to energy. In a 2012 paper, “No way out? The double-bind in seeking global prosperity alongside mitigated climate change”, T. J. Garrett, at the University of Utah, performed the calculations and determined that every single dollar (US dollar, 1990) of global economic growth in recent decades required approximately 9.7 milliwatts of energy. “Global CO2 emission rates” wrote Garrett, “cannot be decoupled from wealth through efficiency gains.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Wealthy nations, such as the UK and US, have claimed to “decouple” energy use from GDP, but only because they have exported energy-intensive industries and now import finished goods — cars, computers, trinkets — which represent massive embedded energy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, Thunberg is correct that the only paths out of our predicament require that we “change the system itself.” Global heating, biodiversity loss, environmental toxins, nutrient cycle disruption, and all other ecological challenges arise as symptoms of a single, larger biophysical reality. Humanity is in a state of ecological overshoot. There is no way to grow out of overshoot. All genuine solutions to overshoot require that the species contract, not grow. As Thunberg says, it is time to face these facts, to slow down, and to “pull the emergency brake” on economic growth.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is the reality that the climate conference delegates are too scared to voice. Our status quo economic system — industrial capitalism — requires growth to survive. Without endless economic growth, the $250 trillion global debt to bankers and investors cannot be paid. As Thunberg says, “Our biosphere is being sacrificed so that rich people .. can live in luxury.” The biosphere is being sacrificed so bankers can receive their interest payments, to keep stock prices up, and to avoid facing reality.\n",
            "\n",
            "The current system is biased for the rich to get richer, as multitudes suffer, as the ecosystem collapses, and as other species disappear. Economist Jeremy Grantham concurs in “The Race for our Lives,” when he states that “capitalism and mainstream economics simply cannot deal with these problems.”  Corporate sabotage of the climate talks is not new. In the 1920s and 30s, Standard Oil, General Motors, and Firestone Tires acquired and sabotaged public transportation throughout North America for the purpose of replacing efficient public transport with gas-guzzling cars. Today in Nigeria, Ecuador, Canada, in the Arctic, around the world, and at these UN conferences, oil companies are still sabotaging the public interest for profits.\n",

Unfortunately, very few people in Russia is aware of sustainable development concept or the real threats of Climate Change. Hence, nor government nor society act to introduce the real changes. Anton is afraid of the catastrophe the humanity is rashing to and the lack of strong actions by the one in charge. Anton got into this most popular show for gifted kids to advocate for peace, equality and sustainability by performing SDGs of UN in 10 different languages in prime time. The supportive feedback and interest we got from the audience showed that people in Russia and all over the world is tired of inactions and dream about eco-friendly and healthy future.

            "Why are global politics so dysfunctional that the UN climate meeting requires a 15-year-old Swedish grade school student to speak the truth? Why does a coalition of youth, outside the COP 24 climate meeting articulate a more comprehensive action plan than the delegates inside the meeting?\n",
            "\n",
            "The world’s youth have finally seen and heard enough from the deplorable political process, from compromised delegates, corrupted political appointees, and criminal corporations who sabotage these critical international discussions.\n",
            "\n",
            "The truth of our ecological crisis is not difficult to see. Fragile ecosystems are unraveling all around us. We have been warned by scientists for two centuries: by the 1972 “Limits to Growth” study, William Catton’s 1980 book “Overshoot,” by reliable scientists, and by millions of ecology activists. We were warned by the 2009, Nature article, “Planetary Boundaries” showing that humanity has breached seven critical tipping points; and by the 2012, Nature article, “Approaching a State Shift in Earth’s Biosphere,” by 22 international scientists warning of an “irreversible” planetary-scale transition, “unknown in human experience.”\n",
            "\n",
            "And yet, politicians and delegates travel around the world, stay in luxury hotels, and dither about our children’s future, as carbon emissions rise, species blink from existence, rivers run dry, and ancient forests burn. It is no wonder, and a welcome sight, that the world’s youth have seen enough and are not impressed.\n",
            "\n",
            "On 12, December 2018, at the COP 24 UN climate conference in Katowice, Poland, Swedish student Greta Thunberg finally said what the politicized delegates have failed to say. Thunberg is a direct descendant of Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius, who predicted global heating from carbon emissions in 1896.\n",
            "\n",
            "During this year’s heat wave and wildfires in Sweden, Thunberg gained world attention by staging a school strike outside the Swedish Riksdag, holding a sign that read, “Skolstrejk för klimatet” (school strike for climate). She demanded that the Swedish government reduce carbon emissions. Her actions inspired student strikes in over 270 cities around the world.\n",
            "\n",
            "Speaking on behalf of Climate Justice Now, Thunberg chastised the delegates and member nations for failing to take action appropriate to the climate crisis: “Until you start focusing on what needs to be done rather than what is politically possible, there is no hope. We can’t solve a crisis without treating it as a crisis. We need to keep the fossil fuels in the ground.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Thunberg pointed out that “if solutions within the system are so impossible to find, maybe we should change the system itself,” and she spoke directly to the errors and injustice of our economic system. “Our biosphere is being sacrificed so that rich people in countries like mine can live in luxury. It is the sufferings of the many which pay for the luxuries of the few.”\n",
            "\n",
            "She exposed the errors of convenient but false solutions that have displaced the genuine solutions to climate change and ecological collapse. “You only speak of green eternal economic growth because you are too scared of being unpopular,” she said. “You only talk about moving forward with the same bad ideas that got us into this mess, even when the only sensible thing to do is pull the emergency brake.”\n",
            "\n",
            "“We’ve had thirty years of pep-talking and selling positive ideas,” she said in Stockholm prior to departing for Poland, “And I’m sorry, but it doesn’t work. Because if it would have, the emissions would have gone down by now — they haven’t.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Meanwhile, outside the conference, 330 organizations from 129 countries presented six “People’s Demands for Climate Justice,” beginning with “Keep fossil fuels in the ground and end subsidies to fossil fuel industry”.\n",
            "\n",
            "The youth leaders urged nations to “reject false solutions” — techno-fixes and offsetting schemes — in favour of “real solutions that are just, feasible, and essential.”  They particularly called out corporations and rich nations, who use the excuse of carbon sinks to seize indigenous land.\n",
            "\n",
            "They called on the rich nations, whose historical carbon emissions have caused the climate crisis, to accept their fair share of climate reparation costs by honouring their Green Climate Fund obligations.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, the coalition demanded that UN conferences end “corporate interference” and sabotage of the climate talks. Extraction corporations “have been getting massively wealthy,” said Sriram Madhusoodanan from Corporate Accountability. “They’re in these talks, blocking real solutions and advancing false solutions that will continue to propagate their business model.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Thunberg is correct about years, decades, of pep-talks and positive ideas that have failed to reduce carbon emissions. Scientists have known about the threat of global heating since Thunberg’s ancestor, Arrhenius calculated the impact in the nineteenth century. The modern world has been meeting about the crisis for almost forty years, since the first World Climate Conference in Geneva in 1979. Since then, human carbon emissions have doubled from about 5 gigatonnes of carbon per year (GtC/yr) to 2018’s record-breaking 10.88 GtC/yr. Meanwhile, CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has grown by 22%, from 337 parts per million (ppm) in 1979 to over 412 ppm today. These results represent an enormous failure on the part of world governments.\n",
            "\n",
            "She is also correct about the unfulfilled promise of “green growth,” a notion made popular in 2012, at the UN Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro, by the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, both dedicated to industrial growth.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, recent studies show that “green” or “sustainable” growth are delusions. In 2018, anthropologist Jason Hickel reviewed recent data and wrote in Foreign Policy that “green growth .. is based more on wishful thinking than on evidence.” A 2012 study by German resource economist Monika Dittrich and colleagues showed that even under optimum conditions, decoupling economic growth from resource use has not occurred. The United Nations Environment Programme came to similar conclusions in 2016 and 2017 studies. They predicted  that by 2050, with continued growth, resource use would double to 180 billion metric tons per year (Gt/y). Ecological footprint data shows that a sustainable level of resource use is about 50 Gt/y, a limit breached in 2000.\n",
            "\n",
            "Studies have consistently and rigidly linked economic growth to energy. In a 2012 paper, “No way out? The double-bind in seeking global prosperity alongside mitigated climate change”, T. J. Garrett, at the University of Utah, performed the calculations and determined that every single dollar (US dollar, 1990) of global economic growth in recent decades required approximately 9.7 milliwatts of energy. “Global CO2 emission rates” wrote Garrett, “cannot be decoupled from wealth through efficiency gains.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Wealthy nations, such as the UK and US, have claimed to “decouple” energy use from GDP, but only because they have exported energy-intensive industries and now import finished goods — cars, computers, trinkets — which represent massive embedded energy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, Thunberg is correct that the only paths out of our predicament require that we “change the system itself.” Global heating, biodiversity loss, environmental toxins, nutrient cycle disruption, and all other ecological challenges arise as symptoms of a single, larger biophysical reality. Humanity is in a state of ecological overshoot. There is no way to grow out of overshoot. All genuine solutions to overshoot require that the species contract, not grow. As Thunberg says, it is time to face these facts, to slow down, and to “pull the emergency brake” on economic growth.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is the reality that the climate conference delegates are too scared to voice. Our status quo economic system — industrial capitalism — requires growth to survive. Without endless economic growth, the $250 trillion global debt to bankers and investors cannot be paid. As Thunberg says, “Our biosphere is being sacrificed so that rich people .. can live in luxury.” The biosphere is being sacrificed so bankers can receive their interest payments, to keep stock prices up, and to avoid facing reality.\n",
            "\n",
            "The current system is biased for the rich to get richer, as multitudes suffer, as the ecosystem collapses, and as other species disappear. Economist Jeremy Grantham concurs in “The Race for our Lives,” when he states that “capitalism and mainstream economics simply cannot deal with these problems.”  Corporate sabotage of the climate talks is not new. In the 1920s and 30s, Standard Oil, General Motors, and Firestone Tires acquired and sabotaged public transportation throughout North America for the purpose of replacing efficient public transport with gas-guzzling cars. Today in Nigeria, Ecuador, Canada, in the Arctic, around the world, and at these UN conferences, oil companies are still sabotaging the public interest for profits.\n",
            "\n",
            "It gives us some measure of hope that young leaders appear to be among the few who have the courage and insight to speak the truth. Greta Thunberg closed her short talk by announcing, “We have not come here to beg world leaders to care… We have come here to let you know that change is coming, whether you like it or not.”\n",

            "As her media presence has grown, Thunberg has become the voice of youth exasperation with policymakers’ failure to mandate dramatic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions in the face of catastrophic climate change. “Our house is on fire,” she said in a January speech at Davos. “I don’t want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day. And then I want you to act.”\n",
            "\n",
            "What Thunberg and her fellow protesters want from governments now is to “keep fossil fuels in the ground, phase out subsidies for dirty energy production, seriously invest in renewables and start asking difficult questions about how we structure our economies and who is set to win and who is set to lose,” as they put it in the Guardian. And they have the backing of thousands of scientists who’ve signed letters of support.\n",
